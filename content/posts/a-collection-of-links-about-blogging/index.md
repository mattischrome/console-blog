If you are thinking about making your own blog, here are some links to help you on your way.

This is a very simple introduction to making websites that Pixel Shannon wrote for her daughter to help her create a website for a class project. It's not completely at a 12 year old's level, so don't be put off by that idea. She gives a very good introduction to what HTML is and what else you have to put in there to get a website up and running. There's also a big list of resources that I won't repeat here, so be sure to check those out too:
