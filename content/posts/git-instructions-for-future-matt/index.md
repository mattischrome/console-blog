Dear Future Matt,

1.  Always look up instructions for what you want to do in the Git documentation. It's dry but it's good. In a pinch, look at Stack Overflow. Don't ask Chat-GPT for advice on Git problems!
2.  To reverse mistakes, consult the [Oh Shit Git](https://ohshitgit.com) website.
3.  To make things easier, delete the remote to your Github repository and then add it (the remote) back again. This is so much easier than the alternative.

Best wishes,
Past Matt (with his annual flash of January git confidence).
