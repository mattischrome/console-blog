description: "How a lost post about Gorgo derailed my attempt to write a guide to Civilization VI"

I've written some guides about how to play as various leaders in Sid Meier's Civilization VI, covering [Hojo](https://mattischrome.com/posts/civ-leaders-1/), [Alexander](https://mattischrome.com/posts/civ-leaders-2/), [Amanitore](https://mattischrome.com/posts/civ-leaders-3/), and [Qin](https://mattischrome.com/posts/civ-leaders-4/) in his Mandate of Heaven persona. I'm also pretty sure I've written a guide to Gorgo at some point but all I can find are the game screenshots I made while I was playing as her.

As such, I managed to lose lots of momentum on what would have been quite a nice writing project. However, with less than a month to go until Civ VII, I don't think writing those posts would be useful even for me.

Will I write similar posts for Civ VII when it comes out? Well, it looks as though the developers have planned for maximum replay-ability with a progression system for the leaders and civs, so it might be difficult to reliably pin down what it means to play as a particular leader. Furthermore, the new game introduces a system where you change civilisation at particular points in history. I'm on board with that, I think that's really interesting, but it further diminishes the role of the leaders and the civs in determining what makes a successful play through.

So it remains to be seen. It feels like learning to play Civ VII will be less about deciding how your civ and leader lean into particular game systems and more about using the resources around you in a consistent way to get good results every time. I'm sure after a while certain leaders will reveal themselves to be especially strong in given situations, and that later era civs will give you an opportunity to either consolidate a strong position or recover from a weaker one. That's probably when the guides will need to be written.

For now, thanks to a missing draft of the Gorgo post, all my Civ guides are on hold!
