This is a quick blog post to say Happy New Year. I've got lots of things to write about, including my favourite albums of last year and a whole month in Australia. Obviously you don't spend a whole month in Australia and blog about it while you're there because someone will come and rob your house.

So anyway, there's a whole load of posts I need to write about: some books, all sorts of things really. Looking forward to doing that.
