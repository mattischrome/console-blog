About eighteen years ago, I got a copy of Nicola Barker's "Darkmans" for Christmas. It's a hefty novel, one of those small runs where the 'hardback' is actually a paperback. I have the first edition and it's ginormous. I read it at home because I couldn't really take it anywhere. 

But I got through it with the help of the following hack. <!--more-->Thanks to the languid pace at which I was writing my PhD thesis, I often found myself reading in the afternoons. I decided one day that I would 'break the back' of Darkmans by reading fifty pages in one sitting.{{< marginfigure src="./images/nicola-barker-darkmans.jpg" alt="Cover of Darkmans by Nicola Barker" caption="Cover of Darkmans by Nicola Barker. This is the same as my first edition copy." >}} It didn't seem like that difficult a task at the outset. I put another bookmark in fifty pages ahead and set off on my quest.

I struggled. Darkmans is a dense book with lots of convoluted and interwoven story lines. Different characters have different fonts. One of them is the ghost of a medieval jester. Not everything really makes sense. The plot is tenuous at best. I can remember sprawling across the bed in my student digs, determined to get through those pages, but every few minutes I found I needed to prop myself up on my elbows in a slightly different way, or that I now really wanted that other cup of tea.

I felt a small bit of shame about how long that first fifty pages took me, but I got there. I don't know if I got into the rhythm the very next day, or whether it took a bit longer than that, but I eventually enjoyed Darkmans a lot. More than that, I found typos in it, and recognised plot points from articles I'd read in The Guardian. I became a bit obsessed with it and ploughed on.

I've moved a lot over the years. It's one of the books I loved enough to put in storage while I was in [South America](/tags/south-america/). Even now, I know exectly where it is on my shelves. Buried behind a pile of books that desperately want to be read in the same way. It's glowing back there, I'm sure of it. I don't know if I will read it again, although in 2025 I read two books that reminded me a lot of Darkmans, which is what motivated this post. I'll write about the other two in the next couple of days as a way of getting back into writing here more often.

If I do re-read it, I'll write a proper review. After all, you know how much I hate [orphan](/posts/the-orphan-project/) posts!
