title: Patch (A poem)
---
This is a short poem I wrote for Ingrid about our little herb garden. I am reproducing it here in celebration of work that is shortly going to start on our new garden!

## Patch

What should we do with our thyme  
And our sage  
And our mint for that matter?  
(Vietnamese or otherwise)  
What is to become of our Basil  
Our dill and bay  
Our parsley  
And other such things that grow?  

What then of tarragon  
And marjoram  
Of all the things we might blend  
And make anew  
And then wait  
For the change of seasons  
For bluer skies  
And more thyme
