I'm having trouble finding something to write about today. Partly the problem of having a productive weekend of doing things rather than ruminating on blog topics. So unfortunately, we get another space-filling post.

I've got lots of books on the go at the moment, including "Orbital" which won the Booker prize this year and "Otherlands" which is a really cool book about natural history going back in time through the eras of the Earth.

Hopefully I can finish either of these pretty soon and write a review!
