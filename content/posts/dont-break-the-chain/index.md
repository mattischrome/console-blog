title: Don't Break The Chain
---
2025 might be a tough year, but I am going to try and blog every day. It means that now and then I might be writing a post like this one, where I am writing for the sake of continuing the streak. If I find myself doing that too often then I will take the hint and stop trying!

This weekend was the 3rd round of the FA Cup, which is when the premier league and championship teams enter the competition. This is the first time for quite a few years where Portsmouth have entered at this stage. Naturally, they're already out! Mind you, in recent years when they've entered at the first round they haven't made it past those rounds either. That was bad news for one pub in Portsmouth which always made a big show of not taking down their Christmas decorations until Pompey were out of the FA Cup!
