We had great success with our sticky toffee pudding as a Christmas Day dessert. It's a hybrid of a recipe by Jamie Oliver, one that we found in a gluten free cookbook, and one for [a make-ahead pudding by the hairy bikers](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/sticky_toffee_pudding_25161).

## Ingredients

### Pudding

+ 200-250g chopped dates
+ 200ml boiling water (or tea)
+ 100g softened unsalted butter
+ 1 teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda
+ 170g sugar (85g golden caster, 50g light soft brown, 35g dark soft brown)
+ 170g self-raising flour
+ 1/2 teaspoon mixed spice
+ 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
+ 2 eggs (room temperature)

### Sauce
+ 110g unsalted butter
+ 110g sugar (half light soft brown sugar, half dark soft brown sugar)
+ 140ml double cream

## Method

### Pudding

1. Soak the chopped dates in the boiling water with the bicarbonate of soda for 30 minutes.
2. Mash the dates with a fork.
3. Cream the butter and sugar.
4. Add the eggs and flour and spices.
5. Mix the dates in to the batter and spoon into a greased baking dish.
6. Cook for 45 minutes at 180˚C. Check with a skewer and if it comes out with batter on, return to the oven for 5-10 minutes.

### Sauce

1. Add all the ingredients to a small pan and cook together on a low heat. Stir gently initially.

## Notes

1. Make sure you remove the stones from your dates!
2. We did this as a make-ahead for Christmas day. When we made the sauce at the same time as we made the sponge and poured about a third over the top. We let it all cool before storing in the fridge. We reheated for about 20 minutes at 180˚C and microwaved the sauce. 
3. It's very nice (but also incredibly over-indulgent!) served with vanilla ice cream. 
4. The reason for using a mixture of sugars is both for the colour (more dark sugar makes for a more appealing toffee sauce) and for the overall toffee/caramel taste of the pudding. You can change the ratios here to suit your own tastes.
5. It's a fairly lenient recipe so don't get too hung up on exact quantities.
