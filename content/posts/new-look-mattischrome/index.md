Welcome to the new look for my blog. I've had my eye on a more minimal look for a while now. Whether this new look is successful or not depends on how often I write new posts. To that end, this theme also supports a separate (or almost separate) stream of photos. Once I've got back in to the habit of putting photos up, that should be a nice additional stream of content.

So this blog now uses the [Hugo console theme](https://github.com/mrmierzejewski/hugo-theme-console/) and it uses [Terminal.css](https://terminalcss.xyz). I have tweaked it in a few ways, including a swanky [tag page](/tags/) that has given me a big list of orphan tags (e.g. those used only once) to try and write new posts with. Longer term, I intend to borrow the structure and further expand it, while using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for more styling. I've already started trying to do that, but I wanted to get this version up on Netlify to check whether all the structural stuff works.
