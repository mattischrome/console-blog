I sometimes wonder if I picked the correct 808 State album for my understated classics series. That's because today I was listening to their 1996 album Don Solaris and it's pretty darn good. For understated classics I chose their earlier effort _Gorgeous_, partly out of the belief that probably no one else ever would, but also because _10X10_ and _Plan 9_ are such total bangers.

808 State released three singles from _Don Solaris_, three singles that were totally different to one another, to the extent that when you listen to that part of their greatest hits (the excellently titled _808:88:98_) you could be convinced that they were all from different albums.

Those singles are _Bond_, featuring Mike Doughty, the lead singer of long vanished Grunge band Soul Coughing. It's a rattling cinematic epic, full of thunderous bass and a swing at something different. These audacious moves are quite common from 808 State, but this one didn't come off: _Bond_ didn't chart. It's the only one of the three I don't remember hearing at the time of its release.

Next up is _Azura_, which probably did better as it is the most 808 State-y of the singles. A gentle drum'n'bass number featuring Lou Rhodes from Lamb. It also sounds a little bit like Lamb, so perhaps their fans also bought it. Later on, when they released all their old singles to streaming, I found out there's also a cracking remix of this track by Dillinja.

Finally, there's _Lopez_. I had a copy of this on cassette single. I think I bought it for 29p in the Our Price bargain bin or something. There were three tracks: the radio edit, and two remixes: one by the Propellerheads and one by Brian Eno. Back then I was quite into the Propellerheads, so I was eager to hear their "Hard-on" mix. Now I'm probably more into Brian Eno. Anyway, it's a great song written with and sung by James Dean Bradfield of the Manic Street Preachers. It's one of those rare beasts written in 5/4 time (literally the only other one that comes to mind as I type is _Money_ by Pink Floyed) and has a strange unworldly aura as a result.

The rest of the tracks on _Don Solaris_ are instrumental and just like the singles they are all over the shop, except in terms of quality. I
