I sometimes wonder if I picked the correct 808 State album for my understated classics series. That's because today I was listening to their 1996 album _Don Solaris_ and it's pretty darn good. For understated classics I chose their earlier effort _Gorgeous_, partly out of the belief that probably no one else ever would, but also because _10X10_ and _Plan 9_ are such total bangers.

808 State released three singles from _Don Solaris_, three singles that were totally different to one another, to the extent that when you listen to that part of their greatest hits (the excellently titled _808:88:98_) you could be convinced that they were all from different albums.

Those singles are _Bond_, featuring Mike Doughty, the lead singer of long vanished Grunge band Soul Coughing. It's a rattling cinematic epic, full of thunderous bass and a swing at something different. These audacious moves are quite common from 808 State, but this one didn't come off: _Bond_ didn't chart. It's the only one of the three I don't remember hearing at the time of its release.

Next up is _Azura_, which probably did better as it is the most 808 State-y of the singles. A gentle drum'n'bass number featuring Lou Rhodes from Lamb. It also sounds a little bit like Lamb, so perhaps their fans also bought it. Later on, when they released all their old singles to streaming, I found out there's also a cracking remix of this track by Dillinja.

Finally, there's _Lopez_. I had a copy of this on cassette single. I think I bought it for 29p in the Our Price bargain bin or something. There were three tracks: the radio edit, and two remixes: one by the Propellerheads and one by Brian Eno. Back then I was quite into the Propellerheads, so I was eager to hear their "Hard-on" mix. Now I'm probably more into Brian Eno. Anyway, it's a great song written with and sung by James Dean Bradfield of the Manic Street Preachers. It's one of those rare beasts written in 5/4 time (literally the only other one that comes to mind as I type is _Money_ by Pink Floyed) and has a strange unworldly aura as a result.

The rest of the tracks on _Don Solaris_ are instrumental and just like the singles they are all over the shop, except in terms of quality. _Bird_ is a classic 808 State instrumental track (save for a little vocal snippet that says "three feet deeper") with _Pacific_ vibes and a chunky bass line. It slots in nicely between _Bond_ and _Azura_.

_Black Dartangnon_ starts mellow but it doesn't take long for a burbling acid line to appear, though at around the same time we get another Saxophone hook (or at least a synth patch that sounds like one) that's also very _Pacific_. As the track develops it's a patchwork of repeating sequences shifting through different instruments. It's very chilled out but if you listen closely there's a lot of animation in the details. It feels like a track that would be easier to make now than thirty years ago - but the result is good and probably inspired all the gear and software that made writing electronic music easier.

_Joyrider_ is much more animated, complete with house-y stabs and a loose wandering bass line. The sax patch is evident again, it's very much the unofficial instrument of _Don Solaris_. There are two remixes on the expanded reissue including a nice long version by Sure Is Pure. The album version builds up speed as it reaches its climax, leaving the intro to _Lopez_ to feel like a swoon as the album slips into woozy 5/4 time for a bit.

There are no singles on the second side of _Don Solaris_ and not really much to anchor things down, the whole side is a suite of (mostly) instrumentals. It begins with _Balboa_ which is pretty squelchy and is almost as aggressive as _Bond_. To my mind it sounds like early Orbital, but perhaps with a bit more going on. The drum programming is awesome, keeping the rather simple riffs on top in check. Then at about 2:00 it shifts up another gear. This is where you can be a bit freer with instrumentals to build tracks up and let them really take off. There's also a nice acid-y section where the BPM shifts down a bit with that buttery sensation of time slowing down for a bit (even if the drum pattern keeps battering away). _Balboa_ is a really nice 808 State deep cut, by the end it's almost like one of Aphex Twin's more intense tracks.

Then we have _Kahoutek_, which (sadly) isn't a cover of the R.E.M. song, but is completely different to the track before it. This is pretty much the one norm of _Don Solaris_. It starts with an incoherent drum pattern before lurching into a funky drum and bass beat, but when the melody kicks in at about 1:15 it's quite spooky until it collapses back into the patterns from the intro about a minute later. Then we get hummed vocals and a simple piano figure before the biggest beat of the whole track kicks in. Again its a track that is freed from the structural constraints of a vocal track and uses that to good effect. As a whole, it's an interesting journey and perhaps the absence of any remixes means the band thought "job done".

And this is the point where I have to own up: I completely forgot that there's another vocalist on _Don Solaris_ and that there's also another vocal track: _Mooz_. Not only that but the vocalist is Ragga who is also on Tricky's _Maxinequaye_ album, albeit on a track everyone forgets about that squirelled away near the end of side two. Ragga's performance is impassioned and great to listen to but I think it does suffer in comparison with _Azura_ both musically and lyrically. (Fun fact: _Mooz_ did appear on a 10" promo single called _Sawnoff Dali_ along with _Bond_ and the next two tracks _Jerusahat_ and _Banacheq_.)

_Jerusahat_ is upbeat and dayglo. In some ways it's closest in sound to _Joyrider_ - but also to a track called _Crash_ that was the bonus track on their greatest hits compilation _808:88:98_ (fewer steel drums though). About three and a half minutes in there's what sounds like a really slowed down electric guitar solo - or at least something weird like that. I think more should be made of dance music that just makes you feel good.

The album ends with _Banacheq_ which somehow crams in hip-hop vocal samples, electric guitar solos, and breakbeats. It might have been inspired by Beck's _Odelay_. It's completely bonkers, definitely not a track that sees the album off into the sunset.

In many ways _Don Solaris_ is the reverse of many dance albums, it starts stately and ends up manic, leading you from the chill out room to the dance floor. Perhaps I really should have chosen it over _Gorgeous_!
