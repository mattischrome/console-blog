title: Gluten Free Toad In The Hole
---

This is a weekly lifter of spirits during the winter months!

## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp of sunflower oil or other high smoke point oil
- 60g cornflour
- 60g gluten-free flour
- 3 eggs
- pinch of salt (if wanted)
- pinch of sage (if wanted)
- 200ml of milk (substitute with non-dairy options if wanted)
- Four sausages

## Method

1. Preheat an oven to 220C (200C for a fan-assisted oven).
2. Pour some high smoke-point oil into a metal pan (approx one tablespoon), add the sausages and warm for five minutes in the oven while preparing the batter.
3. Mix flour, cornflour and eggs either by hand or with a stand mixer. Beat to a smooth paste.
4. Add salt if using. Once the mixture is smooth, start to slowly add the milk while continuing to beat the mixture.
5. Once all the milk has been added, continue to beat the mixture for a further minute or until lightly foaming.
6. Turn the sausages and return to the oven for two more minutes. In this time add dried herbs to the batter if using. Sage works well. Re-beat the mixture once last time.
7. Add the batter to the pan and cook for 25 minutes.

## Notes

- Flour ratios can be changed. E.g., you can use 70g/50g cornflour to flour. Don't use more than 125g total for the flours.
- You may need slightly more oil if using vegetarian sausages.
- In terms of alternative milks, a pea-based milk (e.g. Wunda milk) produces quite an aerated and crispy batter. We've had less success with things like oat or soy milk. 
- This batter can also be used for Yorkshire pudding and for pancakes.
- Try wrapping the sausages in bacon for a tasty (but rather unhealthy treat).
- Most recipes prefer lard to oil, but oil is usually fine. Rape seed oil (AKA canola oil) is working well for us at the moment.
