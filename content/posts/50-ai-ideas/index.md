I have this terrible habit of picking up cool books from the library and then not reading them. One of these has been "50 AI Ideas You Really Need To Know" by Keith Mansfield. This is post is an attempt to force myself to read the book by listing all the 50 ideas and make some comment on them.

The book is pretty good, although it mentions Elon Musk way too many times. My version will mention that person a total of zero times. I've also redacted every mention of him in the copy I got from the library. This is technically vandalism, but also an act of mercy for following readings.

## Idea 1: Alan Turing was very clever

There is a reason why Alan Turing is on the fifty pound note. It's because he pretty much invented the idea of computer science before computers even existed. He was a true visionary, not just a berk who bought a social network.

Back when I was doing my PhD, a colleague of mine was reading Turing's original works in mathematical biology. I can't remember what the paper was about - I hazily recall something about tumour growth - but he urged me to read them too. I couldn't really get into the notation he was using, but it did strike me how modern his presentation of the topic was. It's a sign of genius to communicate complex ideas simply.

Mind you, he was convinced that telepathy was real.

The Turing test...

## Idea 2: Computers have existed for a long time, theoretically

First, the term computer would have had a different meaning even a hundred years ago. The term would instead refer to a group of individuals tasked with performing parts of a calculation according to a mathematical scheme. Newton used a computer, it just happened to be a room full of undergraduates.

Then of course there is Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage's Difference Engine, which as far as I can tell was never actually built.

And then there's the Antikythera Mechanism, which is definitely something I want to learn more about. Found in a shipwreck in XXXX, it is actually a complex device for ?????. Its purpose was recently proven by scientists who reconstructed the original and determined its function.

## Idea 3: Automatons have intruiged people for a long time

The Mechanical Turk was supposedly a device that played chess. Turns out there was a midget inside. For the longest time, the appearance of thought would imply that a real mind (of a human) was present nearby.

## Idea 4: Something something Ada Lovelace

Yeah so I mentioned Ada Lovelace earlier.

## Idea 5: The Entscheidungsproblem

The Entscheidungsproblem was a challenge from the mathematician David Hilbert to determine whether there was an algorithm to determine whether any given statement of mathematics could be proven. The inimitable and not-overmentioned Alan Turing came up with the idea of a Turing Machine to show that there was no solution to the Entscheidungsproblem.

## Idea 6: Colossus

I've seen Colossus at the National Computing Museum. You should go and see it too.

## Idea 7: The Manchester Baby

Nice name. And so begins the process of trying to make ever smaller computers!
