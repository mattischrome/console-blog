Thai Green Curry is one of our favourites. Often when we are travelling we will find a Thai restaurant and order it. It's a nice way to see how a familiar dish is rendered in your new surroundings. More importantly, it's a dish that's reliably gluten and tomato free.

### Paste ingredients
* 8 g coriander roots
* 1 tsp coriander powder
* 1/2 tsp cumin powder
* 1/2 tsp black pepper
* 1/2 tsp turmeric powder
* 1 tsp galangal
* 1 tsp minced or grated ginger
* 3 shredded kefir lime leaves
* 1 tbsp minced lemon grass
* 1 tsp salt
* 2 tsp brown sugar
* 1 minced long green chilli
* 1 1/2 tbsp canola oil

### Paste Method
Blitz all the above ingredients together into a paste, using a food processor or a pestle and mortar. For the latter, you will need to do this in batches.

### Curry ingredients
* 1 kg chicken thighs cut into strips
* 5 kefir lime leaves
* 1 eggplant/aubergine, diced into 1 cm cubes
* 490g tin of coconut milk
* 1 tbsp fish sauce
* 1 tsp brown sugar
* 1/2 bunch (approximately 20g) Thai basil

### Curry method
1. Make the paste (see above).
2. Put curry paste and above ingredients in a pot and simmer for about 20 minutes.
3. Serve with rice or rice noodles.

### Notes
1. You can replace the chicken with vegetables, beef, or firm tofu.
2. You can also cook some vegetables with the curry, such as shreds of carrots, mange tout, green beans, tender stem broccoli, and baby corn.
3. Remove the lime leaves on serving.
