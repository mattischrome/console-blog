When [I wrote about Maara's "The Ancient Truth"](/2023-albums-07-maara-ancient-truth) over Christmas as part of my albums of the year rundown, I mentioned at the end that I would love to find a copy on vinyl to listen to. Well dear reader I managed to! It arrived today from the Netherlands with minimal fuss. It sounds great and I'm not sure whether my review did it justice: that's the problem with attempting to (re-)review ten albums in ten days with Christmas and New Year all happening at the same time!
