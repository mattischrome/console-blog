      <description>&lt;p&gt;Around this time last year, I wrote in praise of writing a diary. I also rather misanthropically referred to it as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://mattischrome.com/posts/the-negativity-casket/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;negativity casket&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; because I found that I was pouring a lot of negative feelings into the notebook. It&amp;rsquo;s not really a diary as such because I don&amp;rsquo;t write everyday and I also make other non-diaristic notes, but it does appear to have been something of a process that has helped me to work through my negative feelings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things that people tend to start around this time of year is a diary. They usually get filled for as long as your new year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions last.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing in my current diary for a while. It&amp;rsquo;s a Moleskine extra large ruled Notebook in beautiful Prussian Blue, covered in whatever stickers pass over my desk. (Hint: find my address and send me stickers Internet.) This is much more preferable to a &amp;lsquo;real&amp;rsquo; diary because I can leave a few days and then resume. I can also take breaks and write out a bunch of notes on Org-mode or the Julia programming language if I want to (and yes, I did).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
