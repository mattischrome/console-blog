      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Imaginary Girlfriend&lt;/em&gt; is a short autobiography by American author John Irving. In it, he explains the interwoven roles of writing and wrestling in his life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As always with Irving, the book is absorbing from the off, and it&amp;rsquo;s tempting to use the anecdotes here to explain why most of his novels seem to have an underdog narrating them. It&amp;rsquo;s because he loves the work of Dickens so much. I kid. It might be because it is a role he has created for himself, and maybe he likes to write what he knows.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
