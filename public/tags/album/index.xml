      <title>2024 Albums of the Year #1: Bolis Pupul, Letter To Yu</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bolispupul.bandcamp.com&#34;&gt;Bolis Pupul&lt;/a&gt; (the stage name of Boris Zeebroek) is an artist on &lt;a href=&#34;https://deew.ee/catalogue&#34;&gt;Soulwax&amp;rsquo;s Deewee label&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://deew.ee/catalogue/074&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Letter to Yu&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; is his debut album, inspired by a trip to Hong Kong to investigate his family history. It investigates themes of place, family, and identity. We are exposed to everywhere all at once but we&amp;rsquo;re also all &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; somewhere, even if it&amp;rsquo;s somewhere we might not recommend or understand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aside from the theme of the album, it&amp;rsquo;s a satisfying and varied electronic album. You have a pop song early on in &amp;ldquo;Completely Half&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;I thought that I / would fit right in / I&amp;rsquo;m on the border of the state I&amp;rsquo;m in&amp;rdquo;) but the rest of side one is fine electro, peaking with the frenetic &amp;ldquo;Doctor Says&amp;rdquo; and ebbing out with the ringing &amp;ldquo;Spicy Crab&amp;rdquo;. (I realised writing this that the vinyl omits &amp;ldquo;Frogs&amp;rdquo; from the streaming version, but this makes the vinyl version of the album better paced.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2024 Albums of the Year #2: Waxahatchee, Tigers Blood</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tiger&amp;rsquo;s Blood&amp;rdquo; is a glorious bundle of songs that writhe with brains and heart, with love and friendship, and many other complements and opposites. The music is mostly alternative AOR with a distinct country twang. The lyrics were pretty impenetrable to me, at least until I looked them up online (and they&amp;rsquo;re also on the back of the poster that came with the LP), but they&amp;rsquo;re mostly songs of hope and happiness. It was satisfying to listen to an album this care-free, even if there is a hint of darker times in the background.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2024 Albums of the Year #3: Acopia, Acopia</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Acopia are a band from Melbourne Australia with that time honoured line up of one girl and two guys. This eponymous album is their second and it&amp;rsquo;s full of slinky electronic ballads that echo classic 90s trip hop. It&amp;rsquo;s got that same downtempo downbeat vibe, the sorts of songs that revel in sadness but also the joy of a killer bass line.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This album was actually released in November 2023 but I first heard it in January 2024 after reading a glowing review of it. I can remember the first time listening to it, I took the train to see my parents in to hand over a present I&amp;rsquo;d bought for my nephew. (Fittingly, it&amp;rsquo;s his birthday today.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2024 Albums of the Year #4: Adrianne Lenker, Bright Future</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One album that&amp;rsquo;s lurking in the periphery of my &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;understated classics series&lt;/a&gt; is &amp;ldquo;Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe In You&amp;rdquo; by Big Thief. &amp;ldquo;Bright Future&amp;rdquo; is the latest solo album by Big Thief singer-songwriter Adrianne Lenker and it is just as good. Intimate and intricate, it draws the listener in as Adrianne sings live with a very small band. At times you can hear breaths drawn and the sound feels like a small space that you are cocooned in: this could be sound engineering (spatial audio would have us believe anything is possible) but it&amp;rsquo;s most likely equipment set up intelligently in a cosy studio.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2024 Albums of the Year #5: Il Quadro di Troisi, La Commedia</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s interesting that an album sung entirely in Italian ended up being one of my favourites of the year, but perhaps not surprising given well written and arranged these songs are. They&amp;rsquo;re just the right side of electro-pop but also with an air of sophistication.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t speak Italian but I do speak some romance languages, so I can sort of guess what the titles might mean. &amp;ldquo;La Notte&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;The Night&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Il Bucchi Neri&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;The Black Holes&amp;rdquo; (I&amp;rsquo;d thought it was the black mouths but I guess I was close!), and so on. As the for the lyrics, they&amp;rsquo;re catching enough for me to sing a phonetic version of them to myself on many occasions, though I&amp;rsquo;ve no idea what meaning I&amp;rsquo;ve been mangling!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
