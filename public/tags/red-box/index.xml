      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-is-understated-not-understated&#34;&gt;When is understated not understated?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The trouble with writing a series of articles all themed somehow is that eventually you might find something that sits naturally in the sequence but at the same time goes against the grain a little. Et voila, I give you “The Circle &amp;amp; The Square” by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.redboxmusic.net/htm/home.htm&#34;&gt;Red Box&lt;/a&gt;. An album that hardly anyone has heard containing two top 10 UK singles that probably everyone has heard. Don’t get me wrong, it is a complete and utter classic - but it is definitely not understated: it is pompous, pretentious, ornate, artistic, all-encompassing, weird and awesome. I could continue but some innate inner law prevents me from using any more adjectives than that in one sentence. It is a chimeral entity standing way apart from its time, timeless and beautiful. The fact that it sold sod-all copies means that holding &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cherryred.co.uk/cherrypop-exd.asp?id=873&#34;&gt;a CD remaster&lt;/a&gt; makes you feel as if you were clutching a cuddly dodo and thinking “if only, if only…”. So this barking, bonkers, beautiful album gets its “&lt;a href=&#34;https://mattischrome.com/tags#understated-classics/&#34;&gt;understated classic&lt;/a&gt;” status because it just isn’t stated often enough just what an amazing record it is.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
