      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yard Act are a post-punk band from Leeds. &amp;ldquo;Where&amp;rsquo;s My Utopia?&amp;rdquo; is their second album. I first encountered Yard Act in a review of this album, which sent me to look at the excellent video to their non-album single &amp;ldquo;The Trenchcoat Museum&amp;rdquo;. I enjoyed the metatextual references both in the video and the song, so I eagerly added &amp;ldquo;Where&amp;rsquo;s My Utopia?&amp;rdquo; to my library.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the album took a while to win me over. Fourth-wall breaking asides and meta references are fine in a single song, even one as long as &amp;ldquo;The Trenchcoat Museum&amp;rdquo;, but combined over the length of a whole album, it can be a bit off-putting. Nevertheless, WMU? rewards repeat listens (especially on headphones) because it&amp;rsquo;s genuinely funny - I think comedy is an underrated quality in Indie music - and the songs themselves are ace.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s probably no surprise that as we reach the top four (or five if you like) we also get to the two albums The National released in 2023. The first, “First Two Pages of Frankenstein”, was trailed with a big reveal early on in the year, while the second, “Laugh Track”, was dropped all of a sudden in October. Once I got to know both albums, I swung between liking each one more for a while, hence putting them both at the same point in the list and not considering each separately.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../../assets/images/albums-2023/nation-of-language-strange-disciple.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Cover of Strange Disciple by Nation of Language&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It would be remiss of me to claim that this is a placeholder for any number of (quite different sounding) song based albums that came out this year (Yves Tumor, Wilco to mention two) but it feels that way. This album came high up my list of listens because it&amp;rsquo;s a very good breakfast album, one to listen to while getting the Day started - though there are also some bangers on here too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
