      <title>Parquet Courts, Sympathy For Life</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Getting back to my occasional album revisits, I&amp;rsquo;d like to consider the 2021 Parquet Courts album &amp;ldquo;Sympathy For Life&amp;rdquo;. This is partly because I own it on vinyl and put it on the other day while I was doing some rather humdrum data downloading at work. It&amp;rsquo;s that kind of album, quite loose and jam-based.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2024 Albums of the Year #2: Waxahatchee, Tigers Blood</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tiger&amp;rsquo;s Blood&amp;rdquo; is a glorious bundle of songs that writhe with brains and heart, with love and friendship, and many other complements and opposites. The music is mostly alternative AOR with a distinct country twang. The lyrics were pretty impenetrable to me, at least until I looked them up online (and they&amp;rsquo;re also on the back of the poster that came with the LP), but they&amp;rsquo;re mostly songs of hope and happiness. It was satisfying to listen to an album this care-free, even if there is a hint of darker times in the background.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2024 Albums of the Year #4: Adrianne Lenker, Bright Future</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One album that&amp;rsquo;s lurking in the periphery of my &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;understated classics series&lt;/a&gt; is &amp;ldquo;Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe In You&amp;rdquo; by Big Thief. &amp;ldquo;Bright Future&amp;rdquo; is the latest solo album by Big Thief singer-songwriter Adrianne Lenker and it is just as good. Intimate and intricate, it draws the listener in as Adrianne sings live with a very small band. At times you can hear breaths drawn and the sound feels like a small space that you are cocooned in: this could be sound engineering (spatial audio would have us believe anything is possible) but it&amp;rsquo;s most likely equipment set up intelligently in a cosy studio.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2024 Albums of the Year #7: MGMT, Loss Of Life</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know very much about MGMT these days. I haven&amp;rsquo;t read any interviews about their albums. The video to the single &amp;ldquo;Nothing to Declare&amp;rdquo; was brought to my attention by the YouTube channel Justin Hawkins Rides Again. In it he points out how melodically interesting the song is. To be honest I was more than a little bit in love with the video.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2024 Albums of the Year #9: Cassandra Jenkins, My Light, My Destroyer</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first time I listened to this album, I was still off work sick with Covid, but well enough to go out for a walk on what was too hot a day to stay inside the house. I remember it well, recovering from illness does tend to make these things more vivid, but more because I thought it was brilliant, but all out of order. I was, of course, completely wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2024 Albums of the Year #10: Yard Act, Where&#39;s My Utopia?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yard Act are a post-punk band from Leeds. &amp;ldquo;Where&amp;rsquo;s My Utopia?&amp;rdquo; is their second album. I first encountered Yard Act in a review of this album, which sent me to look at the excellent video to their non-album single &amp;ldquo;The Trenchcoat Museum&amp;rdquo;. I enjoyed the metatextual references both in the video and the song, so I eagerly added &amp;ldquo;Where&amp;rsquo;s My Utopia?&amp;rdquo; to my library.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2023 Albums of the Year #4: The National, &#34;First Two Pages of Frankenstein&#34; and &#34;Laugh Track&#34;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s probably no surprise that as we reach the top four (or five if you like) we also&#xA;&lt;span class=&#34;marginfigure&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;../../assets/images/albums-2023/the-national-first-two-pages.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Cover of First Two Pages of Frankenstein by The National&#34; /&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;span class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Cover of &lt;em&gt;First Two Pages of Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt; by The National&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;get to the two albums The National released in 2023. The first, “First Two Pages of Frankenstein”, was trailed with a big reveal early on in the year, while the second, “Laugh Track”, was dropped all of a sudden in October. Once I got to know both albums, I swung between liking each one more for a while, hence putting them both at the same point in the list and not considering each separately.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the purposes of this list, we can consider both albums as one homogeneous collection of songs, though some reviews did pick out that “Laugh Track” has more live drums and the songs on that latter album are looser and longer than their “… Frankenstein” counterparts. I think there are songs that are similar to one another on both albums, and that for those tracks, the song on the first album is a bit better than the one on “Laugh Track”. Some of the songs on “Laugh Track” are almost invisible on the first few listens, songs like “Dreaming”, “Hornets” and “Tour Manager”, though the latter of those three has become one of my favourite songs on both albums.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2023 Albums of the Year #5: Nation of Language, Strange Disciple</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It would be remiss of me to claim that this is a placeholder for any number&#xA;&lt;span class=&#34;marginfigure&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;img src=&#34;../../assets/images/albums-2023/nation-of-language-strange-disciple.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Cover of Strange Disciple by Nation of Language&#34; /&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;    &lt;span class=&#34;caption&#34;&gt;Cover of &lt;em&gt;Strange Disciple&lt;/em&gt; by Nation of Language&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;of (quite different sounding) song based albums that came out this year (Yves Tumor, Wilco to mention two) but it feels that way. This album came high up my list of listens because it&amp;rsquo;s a very good breakfast album, one to listen to while getting the Day started - though there are also some bangers on here too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nation of language are a three piece band from New York. I think one of them is famous for being in a band I&amp;rsquo;ve not heard of (or is that their producer, I must do some fact checking) and two of them are married, even going so far as to have had a gofundme or whatever for the band as a present at a wedding. (That doesn&amp;rsquo;t give off future &amp;ldquo;we are a duo now&amp;rdquo; vibes at all!)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
