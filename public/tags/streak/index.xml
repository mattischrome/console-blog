      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having made it to one post per day in January, we now move into February: that graveyard of good habits for the new year. What is it about flipping over the calendar to a new month that does away with our resolve to continue with our resolutions? My office calendar has a lovely picture of a German steam train in the snow, in case you were wondering.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to reward myself at some point by allowing myself to fiddle with the blog&amp;rsquo;s theme a little more. Over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve probably fiddled more with how the blog looks, rather than focussing on what to write. I&amp;rsquo;ve also turned on Hugo&amp;rsquo;s related posts module. The results are pretty high quality and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to affect the build time of the site. A custom version is still a pet project for the future though.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
