      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, it&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I wrote &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/civ-leaders-3-amanitore-of-nubia&#34;&gt;my last Civ VI leader post about Amanitore of Nubia&lt;/a&gt; and there&amp;rsquo;s been a whole host of new leaders and personas added to the game since then. Among these the number of Chinese leaders has increased from two to five. Therefore it&amp;rsquo;s probably a good time to start writing about one of them, and where better to start than the OG himself, Qin Shi Huang. The recent leader pass has created a new persona for him but today we shall focus on his original version, which is now referred to in-game as his &amp;ldquo;Mandate of Heaven&amp;rdquo; persona.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
