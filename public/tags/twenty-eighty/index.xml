      <description>&lt;p&gt;I bought a Barbara Hepworth calendar in the sale at the Tate Modern shop that I thought was a steal until I realised it was a 2024 calendar, not a 2025 one! However, the joke&amp;rsquo;s on them because I only have to wait until 2029 for the next year that starts with a Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, unlike 2024, 2029 is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a leap year. This means all the days of the week would be wrong from March 1st onwards. It gets worse! The next two years that start on a Monday are 2035 and 2046, both of which quite obviously fail to be leap years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oh dear&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
