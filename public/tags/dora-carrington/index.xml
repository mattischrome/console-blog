      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dora Carrington was an artist loosely affiliated with the Bloomsbury Group and noted for her unconventional lifestyle. Despite a short career, her work had a great impact and &lt;a href=&#34;https://pallant.org.uk/whats-on/dora-carrington/&#34;&gt;a retrospective at the Pallant House Gallery in Chichester&lt;/a&gt; brings together some of her major works.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was a bit confused at the start of the show, as I had got my Carrington&amp;rsquo;s wrong! I&amp;rsquo;d been thinking this was a show about &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonora_Carrington&#34;&gt;Leonora Carrington&lt;/a&gt; who was active later, initially in circles with Max Ernst, and later on in her own right in Mexico City. I will have to wait for a retrospective of her work another time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
