      <description>We went to see the Georgia O&amp;rsquo;Keeffe exhibition at the Tate Modern last year. At the time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know much about her, other than the fact she was famous for painting flowers. And that people get a bit hot under the collar about what those paintings might represent. Was the art world of the 1920s and 1930s so repressed that it managed to get into a lather about some paintings of flowers?</description>
