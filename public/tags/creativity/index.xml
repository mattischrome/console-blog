      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are some photos of Ingrid&amp;rsquo;s pottery, some very pretty pots! (And more complex pieces are on the way!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;./images/Ingrids_pottery_01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A photo of some pots by Ingrid on a table&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;./images/Ingrids_pottery_02.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A photo of some pots by Ingrid on a table, side on&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;./images/Ingrids_pottery_03.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A photo of some pots by Ingrid on a table, from above&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Human in the Loop</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I want to start making generative art again. I can&amp;rsquo;t say I ever did it that seriously but using programming languages to generate &amp;lsquo;art&amp;rsquo; is a pretty fun to while away the hours, especially when one&amp;rsquo;s talents for drawing truculently refuse to improve. Of course, more recently the phrase generative art might be said to have grown to encompass the GPT-class models that generate images from prompts. So what would be the point of coding something, when you can make &amp;lsquo;proper&amp;rsquo; art?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Drawing a line on the page</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ingrid has joined an online drawing class. She sits there on Teams getting feedback on her drawings, while I sit there attempting to absorb everything. I&amp;rsquo;m also learning by doing, by making a line on the page. In some ways, it&amp;rsquo;s instructive to observe the difference in what we learn with and without the feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We bought some drawing materials and nice notepads. But to be honest, I still haven&amp;rsquo;t made room in my day to draw regularly. This is a shame because you do have do these things regularly in order to develop the skill.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
