I was so intrigued by it that I bought the hardcover, which is unusual for me because I prefer paperbacks. I&amp;rsquo;d been excited by reading the first chapter online at the Guardian website and from reading a blog post about the novel written by the author&amp;rsquo;s wife Amanda Palmer. I&amp;rsquo;d not read any of his novels before but they had long been on that &amp;ldquo;to read&amp;rdquo; list that is typically as long as your arm.</description>
