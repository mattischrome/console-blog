      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to settle on a text editor, IDE, and terminal for a long time now. Partly I&amp;rsquo;m limited by what I can use at work because I owe to myself and my colleagues to be able to reproduce all my skills in a work setting. However, part of me has also wandered off a bit after reading about the idea of a &amp;ldquo;personal Development Environment&amp;rdquo; (or PDE I guess, though in a former life that &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation&#34;&gt;meant something very different&lt;/a&gt;), which is essentially an application where you can do anything and have it configured exactly how you like.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m an avid collector of small notebooks. So much so that I have a box full of them in my office. I&amp;rsquo;m not afraid of writing in them, it&amp;rsquo;s just that I&amp;rsquo;ve bought so many over the years I can&amp;rsquo;t get through them quick enough.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
