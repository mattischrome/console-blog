      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was due to have my second vaccination today, but like most people I rebooked to have it a bit earlier. No real side effects this time, save for a bit of malaise. Though that may have just been the thought of opening up the country when cases are still increasing quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying that I&amp;rsquo;d urge everyone to get vaccinated and then to keep turning up for whatever boosters the people protecting us (e.g. JCVI, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the government) recommend in future. It seems like we aren&amp;rsquo;t out of the woods yet, though the vaccination program appears to have had a decent impact on hospitalisation rates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had my first Covid-19 vaccination on Friday. Leading up to it, I was borderline having a panic attack. From about lunchtime I was just all over the shop (the jab was at 7pm). I&amp;rsquo;m glad that the vaccination centres run with such exactitude, but also with a sense of cheeriness. By the time I&amp;rsquo;d had the jab, I was feeling much better just from the sheer relief of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
