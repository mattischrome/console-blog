      <title>What is FFI anyway?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the moment I can’t compile this blog locally because my &lt;code&gt;ruby-ffi&lt;/code&gt; install is somehow wrong and is preventing Jekyll from running on my recently upgraded Mac system. Fortunately the site still compiles on Netlify, or else you wouldn’t be reading this!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s always annoying when you rely on a complex multi-part system and some obscure part fails. It leaves you groping for answers and inventing unnecessary hack solutions. The dreaded old Stack Overflow rabbit hole. FFI stands for &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface&#34;&gt;Foreign Function Interface&lt;/a&gt;, a mechanism that allows code written in one language to be called by another language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A February Project</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hmmm it seems as though the &lt;code&gt;ffi&lt;/code&gt; gem as installed by bundler is not compatible with a Mac that has an M1 chip. This limits my ability to preview blog posts locally. I might have to swap to a more modern static site generator (which is probably easier than working out what &lt;code&gt;ffi&lt;/code&gt; actually does) - seems like a good February project!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
