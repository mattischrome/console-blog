      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ingrid and I renewed our Cineworld passes as it is the season to go to the movies and check out the Oscar contenders. You nod along sagely while dreaming up superlatives to show how much you agree with the taste-makers. Or you can call such-and-such movie a pretentious load of crap.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Wonder Woman: A Short Review</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/wonder-woman-short-review/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed Wonder Woman, which came as a surprise to me given my growing distaste for superhero movies. &lt;a href=&#34;man-of-steel-a-short-review&#34;&gt;I can remember seeing the Superman reboot Man of Steel&lt;/a&gt; with its phallic rockets and its boring boring fight sequences. But almost everything about Wonder Woman exceeded my expectations. It&amp;rsquo;s a well-made superhero movie and better still, it gets to the heart of why these kinds of movies matter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Martian: A Short Review</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/the-martian-by-andy-weir/&#34;&gt;In my review of the book&lt;/a&gt; I mentioned that a film adaptation of The Martian was on the way. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why but it got released earlier than any of the dates that I&amp;rsquo;d seen and so on Saturday I found myself watching The Martian on the big screen. Could the film version deliver the same level of entertainment as the novel? Could Mark Watney (Matt Damon) get off Mars alive?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight I finally caught up with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inherent_Vice_(film)&#34;&gt;Inherent Vice&lt;/a&gt;, Paul Thomas Anderson&amp;rsquo;s adaptation of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Inherent-Vice-Thomas-Pynchon/dp/0099542161/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1437860132&amp;amp;sr=8-4&amp;amp;keywords=inherent+vice&#34;&gt;Thomas Pynchon&amp;rsquo;s novel&lt;/a&gt;. It stars &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001618/&#34;&gt;Joaquin Phoenix&lt;/a&gt; as Larry &amp;lsquo;Doc&amp;rsquo; Sportello who&amp;rsquo;s put on to a case of possible kidnapping by his &amp;ldquo;ex-old lady&amp;rdquo; Shasta, played by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/16/katherine-waterston-jk-rowlings-fantastic-beasts-harry-potter&#34;&gt;Katherine Waterston&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Minions got their own movie, just as I predicted in &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/despicable-me-2-a-short-review/&#34;&gt;my review of Despicable Me 2&lt;/a&gt;. I went to see it this week and I enjoyed it a lot. Here&amp;rsquo;s a short review. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, there are no spoilers here that aren&amp;rsquo;t in the trailer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1935156/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1&#34;&gt;Jodorowsky&amp;rsquo;s Dune&lt;/a&gt; is a documentary about outlandish Chilean director &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandro_Jodorowsky&#34;&gt;Alejandro Jodorosky&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; attempt at a film adaptation of &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/dune/&#34;&gt;Frank Herbert&amp;rsquo;s Dune&lt;/a&gt; in the 1970s. As a big fan of the novel and of science fiction in general, I was very interested in this film. It does not disappoint. It gives a great insight into the mind of a little known (if slightly batty) director and shows even an artistic failure can lead to shock waves that can be felt in later work by others.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I went to see the new Superman reboot &lt;em&gt;Man of Steel&lt;/em&gt; with friends. I really enjoyed it, particularly the more reflective take on the superhero myth. Starting out with the fate of the planet Krypton, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0770828/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Man of Steel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; approximately fuses the events of both the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078346/?ref_=sr_2&#34;&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081573/&#34;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; original Superman movies. We get to see Superman&amp;rsquo;s arrival and childhood on earth and then the arrival of Zod, a maniac bent on replacing the earth and everyone on it with a new race of Kryptonians.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I saw &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Into Darkness&lt;/em&gt; last night in 3D at the IMAX in Waterloo. I am going to have to separate this into a review into two parts, a review of the film and a review of the viewing experience. I am not completely happy with how the film experience is changed by the 3D and the super big screen and I will try to explain what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was fifteen when I first read &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/70401.On_the_Road&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;On The Road&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Kerouac&#34;&gt;Jack Kerouac&lt;/a&gt; and recently, after twice as much lifetime lived, I was able to watch &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337692/&#34;&gt;the film version directed by Walter Salles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, two short reviews in a row. I had the day off work and went to see “Rust And Bone” this afternooon. It’s the new film by Jacques Audiard, who directed “A Prophet” – one of my favourite films of the last five years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I went to see &amp;ldquo;Skyfall&amp;rdquo; last night and I really enjoyed it. I knew nothing about the plot, mostly because I had avoided all discussion of the plot with people who had already seen it and I even avoided reviews as so many these days seem to just rattle off plot points, instead of discussing what makes the movie any good. With that in mind I will obviously try not to give away any of the plot in this brief review.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is about the films of Wes Anderson. I am no expert, I’ve just watched them all recently (inspired by &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/moonrise-kingdom-a-short-review&#34;&gt;seeing “Moonrise Kingdom”&lt;/a&gt;) and spotted a some similarities and differences between the films and I thought it would be fun to write about them. My appearance on Mastermind with “The Films of Wes Anderson” as my specialist subject will have to wait for now. Feel free to add to the discussion in the comments. In case you don’t know what the films are, here they are in order (with links to their IMDB pages):&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Moonrise Kingdom: A Short Review</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight I avoided the first half of the football along with my friend Albert Jan and we went to watch “Moonrise Kingdom” at the wonderful Everyman cinema in Hampstead. It was a real treat in every sense. To start with, the Everyman is a lovely cinema. It is quite expensive but you do get what you pay for: a comfortable seat in a great theatre and the chance to watch more than just the latest blockbusters (though it shows those too). I think it was the only cinema in my area that was showing &lt;em&gt;Moonrise Kingdom&lt;/em&gt;, though it has been out for a while now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dreams Of A Life&lt;/em&gt; is a documentary about Joyce Vincent, a woman who was found in her flat three years after her death surrounded by wrapped christmas presents and with the TV still on. £2400 in arrears on her rent, she was discovered by bailiffs who forced the door down. The film attempts to work out happened to Joyce by interviewing people who knew her. In two other strands that unfold in parallel, various events from her life are re-enacted along with the clearing of her flat by forensics officers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There was much excitement about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1598778/&#34;&gt;Contagion&lt;/a&gt; at work. Finally a movie that explains  as part of the plot! A bunch of us went to see it, mainly to see whether &lt;a href=&#34;http://contagionmovie.warnerbros.com/index.html&#34;&gt;a disaster movie about a global pandemic&lt;/a&gt; could hold up as entertainment and to have a bit of a giggle if it couldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just as with the &lt;a href=&#34;understated-classics&#34;&gt;understated classics&lt;/a&gt; I want to set out my stall early on that good movies are good enough. Both &lt;a href=&#34;why-i-love-betty-blue&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Betty Blue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and today’s choice &lt;em&gt;The Jungle Book&lt;/em&gt; are never going to win any sort of consensus prize for the best movies ever made but they are really good. They also have a personal history attached that makes them worth writing about.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/why-i-love-betty-blue/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I saw &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090563/&#34;&gt;Betty Blue&lt;/a&gt; (original French title &lt;em&gt;37,2 Le Matin&lt;/em&gt;) for the first time in 1996 shortly after having read the book and it remains one of my favourite films to this day. Although there are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.co.uk/images?hl=en&amp;amp;source=hp&amp;amp;biw=1427&amp;amp;bih=1022&amp;amp;q=b%C3%A9atrice+dalle+betty+blue&amp;amp;gbv=2&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;aqi=&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;uss=1&#34;&gt;many obvious reasons why&lt;/a&gt; a sixteen year old boy might like it, I think it does stand up to scrutiny beyond the sex and nudity. This post is a brief explanation of some of the obvious and not-so-obvious reasons why this is a film to be loved and cherished. (It was quite interesting to write this defence of a sexy film!)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the run there has been a bit of a hiatus in this blog. I wrote about how running was making me feel better. In fact, I should have said more. I recently stopped taking the antidepressants that I had been taking for eighteen months. This has been my longest period taking such medication but the running made me feel sufficiently good to decide that I could stop taking them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
