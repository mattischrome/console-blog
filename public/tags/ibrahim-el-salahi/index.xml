      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ibrahim El-Salahi is a modernist artist from Sudan. I believe this exhibition is a first for an African artist at the Tate Modern. Much like &lt;a href=&#34;choucair-at-tate-modern&#34;&gt;the Choucair show&lt;/a&gt; (which is still on everyone!), it&amp;rsquo;s an engaging but too short introduction to an interesting artist that you have probably never heard of.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The pieces are roughly divided between large blank and white ink drawings that are mounted on multiple panels and oil paintings in earthy colours that depict abstract scenes. There are one or two pieces that buck this trend, such as &amp;ldquo;Portrait of Mrs. McKelvey&amp;rdquo; and a couple of other portraits toward the beginning of the exhibition. Frustratingly, pictures of his work are rather hard to come by online and the only two works that I was able to surreptitiously snap while at the show were the mesmeric &amp;ldquo;Reborn Sounds of Childhood Dreams I&amp;rdquo; and the mirage-like &amp;ldquo;They Always Appear&amp;rdquo;. (2020 Update: I have removed some images from posts, these being two of them.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
