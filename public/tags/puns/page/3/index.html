    <p>Jun. 3, 2023</p>
    <p>I&rsquo;ve managed to extract my music library, including all the albums I&rsquo;ve added to streaming, as a CSV file and write a routine in R to select an album at random. The plan is to write about that album for the blog in roughly the time that it takes to listen to that album all the way through. I already did this yesterday for Goldfrapp&rsquo;s Black Cherry.
But I have to level with you.</p>

    <p>Jun. 2, 2023</p>
    <p>This is the first in an unplanned series of album revisits, I will write a post explaining the process soon.
&ldquo;Black Cherry&rdquo; is the second album by Goldfrapp, released in 2003. I bought the lead single Train while I lived in York and also the single of the title track because by then I&rsquo;d discovered M83 and they&rsquo;d done a remix of it.
&ldquo;Black Cherry&rdquo; finds the band faced with following their successful and chilled out debut album &ldquo;Felt Mountain&rdquo;, which back in 2000 had sounded notably weird.</p>

    <p>White rabbits and all that.
Even more than during the pandemic, I&rsquo;m feeling these days like the days, weeks, and months are all blurring into one another. It&rsquo;s getting harder to figure out what year something happened, how the old the cats are, and just how overdue all my promises are. It&rsquo;s definitely getting harder to look at this blog and wonder whether it will ever get back to its heyday of regularly posted updates.</p>

    <p>I gave up writing reviews of movies because:
I never felt I got the balance right between describing the plot and why I liked the film. I don&rsquo;t watch enough movies to be able to draw comparisons that are interesting, just between the small subset of total films that I have watched. I don&rsquo;t know enough about film making to properly describe why a movie made me feel a particular way and how to discuss the different possibilities available to the director, the actors, and the other artists involved with creating a movie.</p>

    <p>A set of rules for living from now on (in no particular order)
Life is too short to look at adverts. Avoid them where possible. Block them if you have to. Embrace risk and chance, as they have contributed the most to where you are now. Intervene into physical things and leave your mark upon them. Draw pictures on the blank pages of books, even if they are dear to you.</p>

    <p>Mar. 15, 2023</p>
    <p>Because I am bored of forgetting what&rsquo;s in my website&rsquo;s Rakefile, I thought I&rsquo;d write a list. Also, as I&rsquo;m probably going to move over to a node based approach soon, it&rsquo;s a handy wish list for my package.json file when the time comes.
Make a new post in _posts named &ldquo;Title&rdquo; rake post[&quot;Title&quot;]
If no title is given, you will be prompted for one. The post will be opened in the editor specified in the Rakefile.</p>

    <p>Jan. 20, 2023</p>
    <p>As with most years, I had hoped to start off 2023 with a flurry of new blog posts. Instead I caught Covid, which knocked me out for most of &lsquo;betweenmas&rsquo; and put paid to my hopes for a productive start to the year. At the time of writing this post, I only just feel like I have begun to get back to &rsquo;normal&rsquo;, or at least as normal as things have been since 2020.</p>

    <p>Oct. 29, 2022</p>
    <p>Went with my friend Nick to see The Orb at Concord 2 last night. The last time I&rsquo;d seen the Orb was back in 2004, at the start of their relatively dry spell. That night, they&rsquo;d been a bit lacklustre despite playing (some of) the hits and a relatively decent album in &ldquo;Bicycles and Tricycles&rdquo;. I left feeling that I&rsquo;d seen the past rather than the future, something that I wouldn&rsquo;t glimpse again in their records until 2015.</p>

    <p>Ingrid and I joined our usual quiz team tonight for the residents&rsquo; association pub quiz. As usual we came third. It&rsquo;s a fairly settled group of attendees and we know our level. We&rsquo;re also quite used to the quiz master and his questions, though I do wish he&rsquo;d acknowledge that pop music continued to be a thing long after the sixties!
There&rsquo;s always a pot luck round. On one round we get to play a joker which doubles your points.</p>

    <p>Jun. 1, 2022</p>
    <p>I began writing this post after realising that it is the first of June and I might as well attempt once more to write a post every day. The speed with which the first of the month comes around, inviting another such promise, always amuses me. But at the moment I am not sure whether this blog will still exist come the end of the month. I think I want to start again in pastures new.</p>

    <p>May. 22, 2022</p>
    <p>Since moving to an M1 Mac, I&rsquo;ve noticed some issues with my second screen that I do not experience with my previous Intel Mac or with my current work laptop, which is a Dell Intel PC running Windows 10.
I get a lot of flickering on the screen, which is intolerable if I have Pro-motion and True Tone turned on. Note that these are options for the main display rather than the external monitor.</p>

    <p>Rosewater is an exciting science fiction novel set several decades after first contact with an alien called Wormwood, that has established itself as a large biodome in Nigeria. The novel follows Kaaro, a thief whose extra special abilities are forged from an unlikely connection with the alien. The whole thing is part sci-fi adventure and part spy novel.
The novel is set in multiple timelines with whole sections of the story told in flashback.</p>
