      <description>&lt;p&gt;So today &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/how-random-should-things-be/&#34;&gt;my random album script&lt;/a&gt; picked out &amp;ldquo;Bright Lights&amp;rdquo; by Ellie Goulding, an album I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure I&amp;rsquo;ve ever listened to. I looked in my music library and there it was! As a result this is not so much an &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/tag/album%20revisit/&#34;&gt;album revisit&lt;/a&gt; as an album _&lt;em&gt;visit&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this album was released in 2010 and did quite well. In fact, &amp;ldquo;Bright Lights&amp;rdquo; is a reissue of an album that was originally released as &amp;ldquo;Lights&amp;rdquo; (February 2010). This version adds seven extra tracks, which explains why it&amp;rsquo;s an exhausting seventeen tracks long. &amp;ldquo;Lights&amp;rdquo; was a successful debut and a few of the singles went top 20, which is what led to its re-release with all those extra songs in November of the same year. (I think this is why it is in my collection, I think I bought it for my mum or for a sibling as part of a Christmas present, and ripped the CD out of curiosity&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
