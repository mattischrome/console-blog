      <description>A hardback book called &amp;ldquo;The Satsuma Complex&amp;rdquo; is all that remains of a mysterious young lady that young lawyer Gary is chatting up in the pub one night. It&amp;rsquo;s a book that everyone reckons is &amp;ldquo;a bit sh*t&amp;rdquo;. But Gary&amp;rsquo;s moping about after the Satsuma lady doing a runner while he was in the loo will have to be put on hold when his friend turns up dead.&#xA;I really enjoyed this book.</description>

      <description>I gave up writing reviews of movies because:&#xA;I never felt I got the balance right between describing the plot and why I liked the film. I don&amp;rsquo;t watch enough movies to be able to draw comparisons that are interesting, just between the small subset of total films that I have watched. I don&amp;rsquo;t know enough about film making to properly describe why a movie made me feel a particular way and how to discuss the different possibilities available to the director, the actors, and the other artists involved with creating a movie.</description>
