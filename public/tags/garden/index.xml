      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve never had one fail&amp;rdquo; says my Dad brandishing his drill on Boxing Day 2022, before heading out into the garden and putting up our Christmas gift, a handsome wooden bird box. &amp;ldquo;If I put it up, they&amp;rsquo;ll come along eventually.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of getting the garden done, we&amp;rsquo;ve been out and about looking for trees. It&amp;rsquo;s quite exciting seeing in person all the trees we&amp;rsquo;ve discussed with our garden designer. Here are some of the species we&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I pulled everything out of our shed and we took the stuff we didn&amp;rsquo;t need down to the dump. No one likes going to the dump, but it was strangely cathartic. It&amp;rsquo;s due in part to letting go of things from the past, but also the fact that I haven&amp;rsquo;t felt up to much lately. It ended up being a sunny afternoon so it was a pleasant walk back after we dropped off the hire car.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a short poem I wrote for Ingrid about our little herb garden. I am reproducing it here in celebration of work that is shortly going to start on our new garden!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, we transferred our Christmas tree to a new pot. Being root-bound as the tree was, it took ages to get it out of the crappy pot from the store and into the new, bigger pot. And I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure it&amp;rsquo;s a bit wonky, which might make the baubles a bit lopsided next Christmas. It looks excellent next to the new bird bath.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
