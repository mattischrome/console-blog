      <title>South America, Part 12</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;uyuni-to-tupiza&#34;&gt;Uyuni to Tupiza&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We left Uyuni the night after the big storm, having stopped just a day or so to visit the salt flats. Our next stop was a strategic stay in Tupiza, a large town encircled with red hills. It resembled many towns that I visited in South America: low buildings arranged in a grid pattern. Not much greenery and plenty of dust billowing about. The reason for our stay was strategic, it&amp;rsquo;s only a short distance to the notoriously fussy border between Bolivia and Argentina. We would leave at 5am the next morning so we would reach the border early in case of a long delay, which can happen at this border.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Perhaps it was because we were travelling uphill or because it was daylight, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem so bad.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../../assets/images/south_america/part_11/02.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../../assets/images/south_america/part_11/03.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We set off to Potosi through strange towns with weird monuments (see the pictures) and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lonelyplanet.com/bolivia/the-southwest/oruro/travel-tips-and-articles/76305&#34;&gt;Oruro where great festivals happen around Ash Wednesday each year&lt;/a&gt; that are famous throughout the continent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Overlong reflection upon the past is one sure way to make yourself unhappy so I try to avoid it. Nevertheless it becomes unavoidable at this time of year, especially if, like me, you are somewhat prone to reflection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At this time last year I was, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mattischrome.com/articles/south-america-trip-part-11/&#34;&gt;as detailed in the most recent report of my South American adventure&lt;/a&gt;, in La Paz, Bolivia. I think I felt as lost then as I do now, though back then I had the novelty of new places and good friends to steer me through. This year I find myself stuck in an expensive flat that I can hardly afford to heat in a city where I hardly know anyone: it seems ridiculous that I had more people around me in La Paz than I do here but there you go.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently started a new job and moved in to a new flat. This means I&amp;rsquo;m too busy to write any long blog posts at the moment. Also I&amp;rsquo;m still not quite at home there, so I tend to spend my evenings tidying up or setting up new things. It&amp;rsquo;s a shame because I have plenty of things to write about (even without observations on moving, starting a new job, etc) but I guess the writing will happen eventually&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a longer form post about artificial intelligence inspired by reading a little bit of &amp;ldquo;The Pale King&amp;rdquo; by David Foster Wallace and putting a picture of a &amp;ldquo;ghost&amp;rdquo; up on Instagram. This might be the last of these that I&amp;rsquo;m able to write for a while.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-not-reading-the-pale-king&#34;&gt;On Not Reading &amp;ldquo;The Pale King&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Pale King&amp;rdquo; is the third and final novel by American author &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newsweek.com/david-foster-wallace-appreciation-david-gates-89371&#34;&gt;David Foster Wallace&lt;/a&gt;. He was working on it when he committed suicide in 2008. It was compiled from incomplete notes and released posthumously in 2011. It deals with several characters around an &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service&#34;&gt;IRS&lt;/a&gt; tax office in Peoria, Illinois&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Album Digest, September 2014</title>
      <link>https://mattischrome.com/posts/album-digest-september-2014/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 30 Sep 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://mattischrome.com/posts/album-digest-september-2014/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Album Digest September 2014 contains four amazing albums, including the long-awaited return from the Aphex Twin, and an album from Cymbals Eat Guitars released about a week after I wondered what had happened to them. Spooky. Rounding out the selection this month are a cool punky-disco album by The Juan Maclean and a truly remarkable offering by Vessel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;aphex-twin-syro&#34;&gt;Aphex Twin &lt;em&gt;SYRO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SYRO&lt;/em&gt; is the sixth album by Aphex Twin and his first official Aphex Twin release since Drukqs in 2001. Announced with a typically cryptic track listing at a month&amp;rsquo;s notice via the dark web, along with artwork that resembles a tax receipt for the costs of releasing the album, his anarchic streak appears intact. Therefore the most suprising thing about SYRO is just how conventional it sounds on first listen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to generate random numbers in R</title>
      <link>https://mattischrome.com/posts/generate-random-numbers-in-r/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://mattischrome.com/posts/generate-random-numbers-in-r/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post deals with how to generate random numbers in R. It is good to know how to generate random numbers with a particular language or software package for at least one of the following three reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You want to test something that depends on a particular distribution.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You’re running a stochastic process of some kind (Branching process, random walk etc) and you need random numbers for deciding whether an event occurs.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You forgot to pick your lottery numbers this week.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let’s step through doing each of these with R. Over time I will write this post out again for C++, Java, Python, and Ruby. This post is just a memory aid that I can use later on and is not meant as anything more rigorous than that. As such it is a living document, I will mutate this post in place as and when I need to. Memory aids are useful for when you haven’t used a particular programming language or software package for a while. Who knows, it might save me a couple of searches with DuckDuckGo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Evie Wyld, All The Birds, Singing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently finished reading &lt;em&gt;All The Birds, Singing&lt;/em&gt;, the second novel by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eviewyld.com&#34;&gt;Evie Wyld&lt;/a&gt;. It’s about a woman called Jake who lives alone on a farm with a dog called Dog on an island somewhere off the coast of Britain. She has sheep to look after but something keeps coming in the middle of the night to kill them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, as the narrative on the island moves forward in the present, a second narrative peels off backwards to explain her past. This takes place in Australia. Jake is still working with sheep but there is a confrontation with a fellow farmhand who threatens to expose a secret from her past. As this second strand unfurls, we begin to see why Jake is jumpy and convinced that the deaths of her sheep represent ill-portent. However, because this second story rolls backwards in jumps, we have to wait until the end for the terrible events that set her on this path.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The album digest returns with five albums by four artists.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Karl Hyde &amp;amp; Brian Eno &lt;em&gt;Someday World&lt;/em&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;HIGH-LIFE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lone &lt;em&gt;Reality Testing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;FKA twigs &lt;em&gt;LP1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mogwai &lt;em&gt;Come On Die Young: Appendix&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;karl-hyde--brian-eno-someday-world--high-life&#34;&gt;Karl Hyde &amp;amp; Brian Eno &lt;em&gt;Someday World&lt;/em&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;HIGH-LIFE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m a big fan of both Karl Hyde’s work with Underworld and of Brian Eno’s stuff so Someday World seemed like a dream collaboration to me when it was released last May. I was a bit underwhelmed by it, to the point of overlooking it for &lt;a href=&#34;https://mattischrome.com/album-digest-may-2014/&#34;&gt;May’s album digest&lt;/a&gt;. Last month they released a follow-up called High-Life, which includes some of the more experimental tracks they’d worked on. Together the two albums are greater than the some of their parts, so I’m writing about both of them together this month.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Haruki Murakami, Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki And His Years Of Pilgrimage</title>

      <guid>https://mattischrome.com/posts/colorless-tsukuru-tazaki/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki And His Years Of Pilgrimage is the latest novel by Haruki Murakami. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/19/haruki-murakami-marketing-publishers-stickers&#34;&gt;It comes with free stickers&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps that tells you everything you need to know about this book, which is slimmer than Murakami&amp;rsquo;s recent efforts. The plot begins with an intriguing premise. Tsukuru is part of a group of close friends and is one day expelled from the group for no reason. Unfortunately, the development of the plot is uncontrolled and by the end  of novel too many holes have developed for it all to hold together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It has a simple drafting model that makes it easy to organise ideas and move between them. Pieces of writing are represented as sheets that can be tagged and grouped together - the grouping can be made manually or using filters. There are no files, the sheets are entries in a single database that is synced with iCloud. Because everything is plain text it won’t eat up your storage space. Individual sheets can be archived for use with Mac Os X’s versions feature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understated Classics #27: A Ghost Is Born by Wilco</title>
      <link>https://mattischrome.com/posts/understated-classics-27/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;whatever-happened-to-that-hat&#34;&gt;I have already given some of the personal background to why I love this album&lt;/a&gt; and now it’s time to give a bit of love to the music itself so I’ll stick to giving a track by track account of “A Ghost Is Born”.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are familiar with Wilco’s first few albums, you’ll know that A Ghost Is Born is on the line of best fit through Being There, Summerteeth, and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. It continues its predecessor’s experimentation, but also gets reined in a little. Great songs - some of my favourite Wilco songs - were left off Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (“&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bemydemon.org/songs/venus.htm&#34;&gt;Venus Stopped The Train&lt;/a&gt;”, “&lt;a href=&#34;http://wilcoworld.net/#!/song/a-magazine-called-sunset/&#34;&gt;A Magazine Called Sunset&lt;/a&gt;”) so the follow-up could easily have been more of the same and everyone would have gone home happy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mattischrome.com/2014/05/south-america-trip-part-9/&#34;&gt;Picking up where I left off&lt;/a&gt; at Machu Picchu, we headed down into Aguas Calientes (trans. “hot waters”) by coach and by the time we got there it was torrenting down with rain. So much for exploration. We waited out the downpour in a pizza place and deliberated over whether to buy souvenier snaps from the tour guides. Ironically for a town named after hot waters, it was bitterly cold. One of those places where the sound of running water follows you wherever you go, the best thing about it was the huge trains that ran down the middle of street - big clanking hulks pulling huge passenger trains.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This is her last novel and is a remarkable book: inventive, funny, and sad, all at once. I found it in a special selection at the local library dedicated to Brazil because of the World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First some biography. Born Chaya Lispector in Chechelnyk, Ukraine, in 1920, her family escaped the pogroms and emigrated to Brazil in 1922. She was given the new name Clarice as the family settled in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lonelyplanet.com/brazil/the-northeast/maceio&#34;&gt;Maceió in north-eastern Brazil&lt;/a&gt;. Later she and her family moved to Rio de Janeiro&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and she started law school there in 1937. Her first published short story appeared around 5 years later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently spruced up a post I wrote four years ago about &lt;a href=&#34;https://mattischrome.com/articles/uc4/&#34;&gt;Biosphere’s wonderful album Substrata&lt;/a&gt;. I added the following footnote about the difference between voice samples and found sound:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suppose I am distinguishing between found sound and vocal samples here. Perhaps there is very little difference, or that one is the other? When is a vocal snippet something more than found sound? Is it the fact that one has meaning? Isn’t a “meaningless” sample - like the ones here in Russian that I can’t understand - little more than found sound anyway?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finally&lt;/em&gt; saw Guardians of the Galaxy today. Here are fifteen observations about the film that may or may not constitute a short review.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;At least two Oscars for &lt;a href=&#34;http://media.comicbook.com/uploads1/2014/07/guardians-of-the-galaxy-gamora-101682-101718.jpg&#34;&gt;Best Use Of Body Paint (Green)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://images.radiotimes.com/namedimage/Karen_Gillan_takes_on_Zoe_Saldana_in_extended_Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_trailer.jpg?quality=85&amp;amp;mode=crop&amp;amp;width=620&amp;amp;height=374&amp;amp;404=tv&amp;amp;url=https://mattischrome.com/uploads/images/original/53103.jpg&#34;&gt;Best Use Of Body Paint (Blue)&lt;/a&gt; are sewn up.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Chris Pratt basically plays Star Lord as “&lt;a href=&#34;http://parksandrecreation.wikia.com/wiki/Andy_Dwyer&#34;&gt;Andy Dwyer&lt;/a&gt; in space” and this is fine by me.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Best movie to feature &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.etonline.com/movies/148845_bradley_cooper_explains_his_voice_guardians_of_the_galaxy/&#34;&gt;a talking raccoon&lt;/a&gt; in a long time.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://screenrant.com/thor-2-dark-world-mid-post-credits-button-scenes-explained&#34;&gt;Watching the entirety of the end credits of Thor 2&lt;/a&gt; paid off!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;“&lt;em&gt;WE&lt;/em&gt; are &lt;a href=&#34;https://uk.yahoo.com/movies/dancing-baby-groot-clip-guardians-of-the-galaxy-94738291414.html&#34;&gt;Groot&lt;/a&gt;” — aren’t we just?! All of the feels.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It features a dance off as a major event, something that it shares with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Step_Up_(film_series)&#34;&gt;Step Up movies&lt;/a&gt;. Guardians of the Galaxy is a waaaay better movie.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The first words of the credits are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mtv.com/news/1887915/guardians-of-the-galaxy-sequel/&#34;&gt;“The Guardians of the Galaxy will return”&lt;/a&gt;. It is in fact a movie that reviews itself.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The 3D version might have been pretty good. I watched the 2D version but &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Guardians-Galaxy-Has-Something-Special-Planned-Its-IMAX-3D-43350.html&#34;&gt;the scenes with lots of action &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be improved with a bit of depth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/11033572/Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Awesome-Mix-soundtrack-tops-Billboard-chart.html&#34;&gt;A great soundtrack&lt;/a&gt;, but there is a cheesy “smooth rock wins chicks” bit that’s a little icky half way through.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;That said, the description of the legend of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087277/&#34;&gt;Footloose&lt;/a&gt; is hilarious. Especially the callback toward the end of the movie.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I especially enjoyed the scene with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slashfilm.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-easter-eggs-quotes/&#34;&gt;the Collector&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Karen Gillen is wasted as Nebula, but &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Nebula-Return-Guardians-Galaxy-2-66648.html&#34;&gt;hopefully she will be back&lt;/a&gt;. Karen’s also in what may well be &lt;a href=&#34;http://abc.go.com/shows/selfie&#34;&gt;one of the most ill-conceived TV shows of all time&lt;/a&gt; later this autumn.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I thought it was Bruce Willis playing &lt;a href=&#34;http://whatculture.com/wwe/batista-praised-role-guardians-galaxy-movie.php&#34;&gt;Drax the Destroyer&lt;/a&gt; (I’m useless at this guess the actor game). I loved his taking things literally: “Nothing goes over my head. My reflexes are too fast, I would catch it.”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you text me at any point in the next month, I will probably reply with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nerdist.com/2014/08/translate-any-website-into-groot-speak-with-this-nifty-new-button/&#34;&gt;“I am Groot”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;No Raccoons or tree creatures were harmed during the making of this film.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;or-at-least-its-subversive-soundtrack&#34;&gt;Or at least its subversive soundtrack…&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I listened to The Orb’s amazing live album “Live ’93” the other day (after discovering the insipid “History Of The Future” collection on Spotify) and I was amazed at how countercultural and subversive it was. I was listening to this stuff at the age of 14 and now that I’m old enough to be a parent, that makes me a bit uncomfortable. Actually it does nothing of the sort, because it&amp;rsquo;s frigging awesome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understated Classics #26: Come On Die Young by Mogwai</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you about punk rock: punk rock is a word used by dilettantes and ah&amp;hellip; and ah&amp;hellip; heartless manipulators about music that takes up the energies and the bodies and the hearts and the souls and the time and the minds of young men who give what they have to it and give everything they have to it and it&amp;rsquo;s a&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s a term that&amp;rsquo;s based on contempt, it&amp;rsquo;s a term that&amp;rsquo;s based on fashion, style, elitism, satanism and everything that&amp;rsquo;s rotten about rock &amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo; roll. I don&amp;rsquo;t know &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_Lydon&#34;&gt;Johnny Rotten&lt;/a&gt; but I&amp;rsquo;m sure&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m sure he puts as much blood and sweat into what he does as &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud&#34;&gt;Sigmund Freud&lt;/a&gt; did. You see, what sounds to you like a big load of trashy old noise is in fact the brilliant music of a genius, myself . And that music is so powerful that it&amp;rsquo;s quite beyond my control and ah&amp;hellip; when I&amp;rsquo;m in the grips of it I don&amp;rsquo;t feel pleasure and I don&amp;rsquo;t feel pain, either physically or emotionally. Do you understand what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about? Have you ever felt like that? When you just couldn&amp;rsquo;t feel anything and you didn&amp;rsquo;t want to either. You know? Like that? Do you understand what I&amp;rsquo;m saying sir? (Iggy Pop, Canadian TV, March 11th 1977.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The hat in question is a Wilco baseball cap that I bought at a gig of theirs in 2004, the night that Germany got eliminated from Euro 2004. I&amp;rsquo;d love to show you a picture of it but I can&amp;rsquo;t, there isn&amp;rsquo;t even a picture of it from a Wilco merch site: at least not one that Google or Bing images can see anyway. I did manage to find a side-on picture of it in my bedroom in 2005 and zoom right in on it like they do in CSI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://temporaryresidence.com/artists/watter&#34;&gt;Watter&lt;/a&gt; are a &amp;ldquo;supergroup&amp;rdquo; composed from various members of Grails, &lt;a href=&#34;http://touchandgorecords.com/bands/band.php?id=70&#34;&gt;Slint&lt;/a&gt;, and other bands. I did not know anything about Hundred Waters before this month: &amp;ldquo;The Moon Rang Like A Bell&amp;rdquo; is their second album. In fact second albums by bands I know nothing about are a something of theme because &amp;ldquo;Sunbathing Animal&amp;rdquo; is Parquet Courts&amp;rsquo; sophomore effort and I don&amp;rsquo;t know anything about them either. Meanwhile, I&amp;rsquo;ve meant to write about &amp;ldquo;The Four Seasons Recomposed&amp;rdquo; since April.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This month was strange. I didn’t listen to much new music and after &lt;a href=&#34;https://mattischrome.com/album-digest-april-2014/&#34;&gt;last month’s bumper digest&lt;/a&gt; there’s probably a reason for that. Not to mention that Spotify gives you more reasons to look backwards than forwards. Nevertheless, this brief post features new albums by Little Dragon and Coldplay, along with the mini-album collaboration between Röyskopp and Robyn.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;little-dragon-nabuma-rubberband&#34;&gt;Little Dragon “Nabuma Rubberband”&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I discovered Little Dragon, like most people, I imagine, via Gorillaz’ “Plastic Beach” album. When I investigated their “Machine Dreams” album I was surprised that their sound had transplanted to “Plastic Beach” intact. Sometimes you discover a band through a collaboration and their own work turns out to be disappointing, somehow diminished by the other artist(s) no longer being present. “Machine Dreams” is a fine album that breezes by, much like “Empire Ants” and “To Binge” do on “Plastic Beach”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a tour full of highlights, Christmas week of 2013 was nonetheless one of the greatest weeks of my life. I may have moaned, groaned, and got completely soaked, but it was worth it to see Machu Picchu in the sunshine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-story-so-far&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Story So Far&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;south-america-trip-part-1&#34;&gt;Arriving in Quito&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;south-america-trip-part-2&#34;&gt;Otovalo and Misahualli&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;south-america-trip-part-3&#34;&gt;Banos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;south-america-trip-part-4&#34;&gt;Ingapirca and Cuenca&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;south-america-trip-part-5&#34;&gt;Into Peru&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;south-america-trip-part-6&#34;&gt;The Road to Lima&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;south-america-trip-part-7&#34;&gt;The Nazca Lines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;south-america-trip-part-8&#34;&gt;Arequipa and Cusco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-sacred-valley&#34;&gt;The Sacred Valley&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On 22nd December, we set off from the hotel in Cusco for a trip along the Sacred Valley that lines the Urubamba river. This valley includes a great number of Inca sites of archeological interest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Should I Drop Dropbox?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am thinking about whether I want to use Dropbox to sync my files anymore. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I love Dropbox. It came along in beta in just 2008 just as I needed it to manage my PhD thesis. In fact I often jokingly claim to having invented it by asking on the MacRumors forums whether a program like it existed  - just a few weeks before its beta rode in to my life like a knight in shining armour. I recognised the need for a service that would synchronise a single directory and its contents between multiple computers using The Power Of The Internet™. I was used to using commands like scp to maintain my static blog on the university&amp;rsquo;s servers and the multiple computers that I authored it from, though in 2008 when I moved back to my parents&amp;rsquo; house to write up my PhD I was frustrated that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t work out how to do the same things when the target was a PC running Windows XP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m back in the UK so it’s back to posts about albums each month. This one is a bit different because I didn’t listen to very much new stuff while I was away so not all of the albums are up to date. I had to write about the new album by Liars though because it&amp;rsquo;s awesome and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait to discuss it! Here’s the list of albums:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tegan and Sarah &lt;em&gt;Heartthrob&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fanfarlo &lt;em&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s Go Extinct&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Liars &lt;em&gt;Mess&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;London Grammar &lt;em&gt;If You Wait&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;tegan-and-sarah-_heartthrob_&#34;&gt;Tegan and Sarah &lt;em&gt;Heartthrob&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would argue, as I have throughout my sequence of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mattischrome.com/tags#understated-classics/&#34;&gt;understated classics&lt;/a&gt; posts, that a great album is one that changes you as a person. Sometimes an album changes your mood consistently, sometimes an album makes you think about the experiences in your life differently, and sometimes an album is just so great and comes along at just the right time to knock you for six. I’d say that in 2014 Tegan and Sara’s “Heartthrob” has been that album for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Arequipa and Cusco &amp;ndash; the two cities that are the subject of this post &amp;ndash; are probably the two cities in Peru that are most amenable to travellers (though Lima certainly has a lot to offer too). For me they should have been punctuated with a trip to &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colca_Canyon&#34;&gt;Colca canyon&lt;/a&gt;, one of the deepest canyons in the world and twice as deep as the Grand Canyon. Unfortunately, I got really sick on the second day in Arequipa as my attempts at keeping my tummy bug at bay finally failed. (Even so, I didn&amp;rsquo;t actually seek any proper medical help till the second day in Cusco, I was pretty boneheaded about it.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Next up was a piecemeal section of the trip that took in a varied set of sights and helped us get to know the new passengers who joined in Lima. On the first day we took a boat trip out to the Ballestas Islands, a nature reserve that is informally known as “the poor man’s galapagos”. Living there are penguins, sea birds, sea lions and seals. The speed boat out was a little wet and wild (and in fact the return trip was even wetter and wilder) so we all got soaked (twice) but the microclimate around the islands themselves was calm and warm, and we all got good value out of our cameras (if they still worked that is). We even saw a pelican get taken down by a sea-lion which was an interesting if not altogether pleasant display of nature red in tooth and claw. Also, who knew that guano was so valuable?!?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From Punta Sal we took a long driving down to Huanchaco, via a stop off at the Lord of Saipan museum. The lord of Saipan is a Moche mummy found dressed in all manner of gold and surrounded by artefacts and other sacrifices (including other humans and decapitated llamas). The tour took a while to get going (our guide was late) but the exhibition was so amazing (the pieces were painstakingly restored in Germany) that it was hugely enjoyable. The diorama at the end featuring moving animatronic waxworks of Moche people was extremely weird though.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
