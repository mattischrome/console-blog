      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27161156-hillbilly-elegy&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hillbilly Elegy&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; is the autobiography of JD Vance, a self-professed hillbilly made good who graduated from Yale Law School. I read it because reviews touted it as illustrating the economic conditions leading to Brexit and the implausible election of Donald Trump. As &lt;a href=&#34;space-between-this-and-that&#34;&gt;I wrote in an earlier post&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;m keen to learn about why Brexit happened. However, I think this book fails to provide an explanation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After I read &lt;a href=&#34;hello-america&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hello America&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;like-a-mule-ice-cream-sun-manyika&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Like a Mule Bringing Ice Cream to the Sun&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; to Ingrid, it was her turn to read something to me. We settled on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.matthaig.com/reasons-to-stay-alive/&#34;&gt;Matt Haig&amp;rsquo;s memoir of anxiety and depression &amp;ldquo;Reasons to Stay Alive&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, which is as uplifting and life-affirming as its title suggests.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Eric Schlosser, Command and Control</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Command and Control&amp;rdquo; by Eric Schlosser is about the history of nuclear weapons and their safety. This might not seem like a thrilling subject, but it&amp;rsquo;s absorbing from start to finish. I started it three years ago but only finished it more recently as the subject of nuclear weapons has become more pertinent to current affairs.&lt;label for=&#34;sidenote-2ba6a6675eed1cbcd81947545d956648-0&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sidenote-2ba6a6675eed1cbcd81947545d956648-0&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&#xA;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;Suffice to say that when I bought the book over three years ago, I would not have believed that it would be so much more relevant by the time I had finished it.&lt;/span&gt; There are many people who would stand to gain a great deal from reading this book.&lt;label for=&#34;sidenote-2ba6a6675eed1cbcd81947545d956648-1&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sidenote-2ba6a6675eed1cbcd81947545d956648-1&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&#xA;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;The name at the top of the list rhymes with Dump.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Eric Schlosser, Gods of Metal</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Y-12 is the United States&amp;rsquo; most secure weapons-grade Uranium storage facility. It is known as the &amp;ldquo;Fort Knox of Uranium&amp;rdquo;. In 2012 it was infiltrated by three elderly peace protesters, sparking a major scandal about the safety of US nuclear sites. &amp;ldquo;Gods of Metal&amp;rdquo; by Eric Schlosser tells the story of that break-in alongside a history of both the anti-nuclear movement (in particular &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plowshares_Movement&#34;&gt;the Plowshares movement&lt;/a&gt;) and nuclear security in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Helen Fisher, Some Lessons In Love</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/some-lessons-in-love/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 25 Jun 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/some-lessons-in-love/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As indicated by my &lt;a href=&#34;articles/reading-list-mid-april-2012&#34;&gt;reading list&lt;/a&gt; posted a couple of months ago (which has since been added to &lt;a href=&#34;articles/another-reading-list&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), I’ve started to try to read more about the things that I felt that I did not understand so well. Most notably perhaps is this book “on love” by Helen Fisher. Lest there is any innuendo it is not a book about technique nor does it attempt to explain love to those who have never known it, instead it assumes that we have all been there. In fact, the book attempts to explain the neurological mechanisms of love (specifically romantic love) and describes how science has helped reveal these mechanisms to us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Mark Rowlands, The Philosopher And The Wolf</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/the-philosopher-and-the-wolf/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/the-philosopher-and-the-wolf/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I saw that a friend had ‘liked’ this book on Facebook and reading about it on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Philosopher-Wolf-Lessons-Death-Happiness/dp/1847081029/&#34;&gt;amazon&lt;/a&gt;, I was curious enough to give it a go. It is the autobiography of the philosopher &lt;a href=&#34;http://rowlands.philospot.com/&#34;&gt;Mark Rowlands&lt;/a&gt;, specifically the experiences and lessons learned from raising a wolf, Brenin, from cub to maturity and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
