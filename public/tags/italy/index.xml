      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s interesting that an album sung entirely in Italian ended up being one of my favourites of the year, but perhaps not surprising given well written and arranged these songs are. They&amp;rsquo;re just the right side of electro-pop but also with an air of sophistication.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t speak Italian but I do speak some romance languages, so I can sort of guess what the titles might mean. &amp;ldquo;La Notte&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;The Night&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Il Bucchi Neri&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;The Black Holes&amp;rdquo; (I&amp;rsquo;d thought it was the black mouths but I guess I was close!), and so on. As the for the lyrics, they&amp;rsquo;re catching enough for me to sing a phonetic version of them to myself on many occasions, though I&amp;rsquo;ve no idea what meaning I&amp;rsquo;ve been mangling!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A little trip to Italy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We bought a cheap package holiday in the British Airways Black Friday sale. The weekend spanned Ingrid&amp;rsquo;s birthday, so it was ideal. Â£99 each for flights and a hotel, and we bagged a hire car quite cheaply too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because our flight was from Heathrow and the trains from Chichester are both expensive and inconvenient for early flights, we spoiled ourselves with a taxi to the airport. It felt very strange to be whisked through the Sussex and Surrey countryside at six am on a Friday morning!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
