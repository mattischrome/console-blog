      <description>Because I am bored of forgetting what&amp;rsquo;s in my website&amp;rsquo;s Rakefile, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write a list. Also, as I&amp;rsquo;m probably going to move over to a node based approach soon, it&amp;rsquo;s a handy wish list for my package.json file when the time comes.&#xA;Make a new post in _posts named &amp;ldquo;Title&amp;rdquo; rake post[&amp;quot;Title&amp;quot;]&#xA;If no title is given, you will be prompted for one. The post will be opened in the editor specified in the Rakefile.</description>

      <description>This post explains some of the modifications I made to a minimal Jekyll theme to get this blog as I wanted it. This blog (currently) uses the excellent Sidey theme by Ronalds Vilciņš. His site looks eerily similar to this one, at least at time of writing.&#xA;The theme is pretty minimal in terms of features (and appearance) but it scores well on the Google Page Speed test. The features I added have increased the build time, but have not affected the speed of the site in terms of the page speed test.</description>
