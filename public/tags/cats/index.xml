      <description>&lt;p&gt;The cats broke their new resolution not to knock stuff over in my office. Oh, who am I kidding? They never had such a resolution! If you can see a sheet of saturated paper, that was my to do list! Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../../assets/images/2024/cat-chaos-2024.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;A knocked over vase of flowers caused by the cats chasing one another&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The cats were either bounding across my desk to get to the window and look at the snow. Or they were just chasing each other around as usual.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He keeps biting me on the leg&amp;rdquo; says Ingrid one day as I mill around her desk during the new water cooler moment that is a comfort break on a Microsoft Teams call. I pat Martok, one of our cats, and he rubs up against me, pretending that he might nibble at me too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I experience this regularly. It used to be at half five, then at five, and these days at half past four. He strides into my office, circles around the chair and nips me on the calf. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why it&amp;rsquo;s getting earlier each day. It&amp;rsquo;s probably a brazen campaign for dinner, but I have been steadfast in feeding them no earlier than the S of six.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
