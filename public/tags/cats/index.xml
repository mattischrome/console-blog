      <description>The cats broke their new resolution not to knock stuff over in my office. Oh, who am I kidding? They never had such a resolution! If you can see a sheet of saturated paper, that was my to do list! Oh well.&#xA;The cats were either bounding across my desk to get to the window and look at the snow. Or they were just chasing each other around as usual.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;He keeps biting me on the leg&amp;rdquo; says Ingrid one day as I mill around her desk during the new water cooler moment that is a comfort break on a Microsoft Teams call. I pat Martok, one of our cats, and he rubs up against me, pretending that he might nibble at me too.&#xA;I experience this regularly. It used to be at half five, then at five, and these days at half past four.</description>
