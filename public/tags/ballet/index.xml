      <description>&lt;p&gt;For Ingrid&amp;rsquo;s birthday, we went to see &lt;a href=&#34;http://moscowcityballet.com/en/repertoire/ballet/1&#34;&gt;The Nutcracker performed by the Moscow City Ballet&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;http://kingsportsmouth.co.uk&#34;&gt;The King&amp;rsquo;s Theatre in Southsea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The original conversation went something along the lines of &amp;ldquo;Matt, please come and see some ballet with me on my birthday! It might not be your thing but I&amp;rsquo;d love someone to come and see it with me&amp;rdquo;. As I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved a bit of Tchaikovsky, I said yes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My only previous encounter with a ballet was an adaptation of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_II_(ballet)&#34;&gt;Christopher Marlowe&amp;rsquo;s Edward II by John McCabe&lt;/a&gt; during my English Literature A-level. We got a day trip to exotic Bristol out of it, which when I was 17 meant the chance to visit all the cool record shops looking for rare KLF vinyl that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford. We also got underage hammered at the pub before going to the Hippodrome to watch a ballet in which a man flounced around with a giant pink strap-on on (as if male ballet dancers didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough of that action going on already!). Needless to say, it did little to convert me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
