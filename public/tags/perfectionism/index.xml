      <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing a blog post every day is not essential. It&amp;rsquo;s not part of some new year&amp;rsquo;s resolution, despite the fact that the start of this unbroken streak of posts was January 1st. If anything my new year&amp;rsquo;s resolution has been to try and step gently away from my perfection. And the adoption of that resolution began in the middle of 2024 rather than new year&amp;rsquo;s day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Around September time, I realised and began to recognise myself as I read many descriptions of crippling perfectionism, especially in how it relates to depression. Depression is a weird experience that is simultaneously subjective but also measurable in many ways. It became clearer and clearer to me that perfectionism was a significant component to my problems, in both work and the rest of life (i.e. the part that is most important). And so I began to try and undo a lifetime of thinking in a particular way, mostly guided by a set of rules that I now write down in all my notebooks. Those rules are for me, so I won&amp;rsquo;t share them here, at least not today. But they are eminently findable on the internet and recognisable variations of common themes in self-help literature. I still need to work out which of them are genuine rules and which are merely guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
