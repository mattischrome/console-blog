      <description>A few weeks ago, Ingrid and I went to see The Threepenny Opera at the National Theatre.&#xA;The Threepenny Opera was written by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill, based on Elisabeth Hauptmann&amp;rsquo;s German translation of John Gay&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;A Beggar&amp;rsquo;s Opera&amp;rdquo;. It was first performed in Weimar Berlin in 1928 and has evolved over time through many adaptations, including several film and off-Broadway versions. It&amp;rsquo;s a work with very powerful musical overtones and, despite avowals otherwise throughout by the narrator, it has a powerful moral message.</description>

      <description>For Ingrid&amp;rsquo;s birthday, we went to see The Nutcracker performed by the Moscow City Ballet at The King&amp;rsquo;s Theatre in Southsea.&#xA;The original conversation went something along the lines of &amp;ldquo;Matt, please come and see some ballet with me on my birthday! It might not be your thing but I&amp;rsquo;d love someone to come and see it with me&amp;rdquo;. As I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved a bit of Tchaikovsky, I said yes.</description>
