      <description>Ingrid and I got married a month ago. It was a lovely day. We had a simple ceremony with two witnesses, our friends Sue and Andrew. We kept it quiet and small, as we just wanted to be married without too much fuss. A month on, we&amp;rsquo;re happy to report that we are glad we did it.&#xA;We&amp;rsquo;d like to thank everyone who nonetheless sent cards and gifts, and to all of those who wished us well on Facebook.</description>
