      <description>&lt;p&gt;So today &lt;a href=&#34;https://mattischrome.com/how-random-should-things-be/&#34;&gt;my random album script&lt;/a&gt; picked out &amp;ldquo;Bright Lights&amp;rdquo; by Ellie Goulding, an album I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure I&amp;rsquo;ve ever listened to. I looked in my music library and there it was! As a result this is not so much an &lt;a href=&#34;https://mattischrome.com/tag/album%20revisit/&#34;&gt;album revisit&lt;/a&gt; as an album _&lt;em&gt;visit&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this album was released in 2010 and did quite well. In fact, &amp;ldquo;Bright Lights&amp;rdquo; is a reissue of an album that was originally released as &amp;ldquo;Lights&amp;rdquo; (February 2010). This version adds seven extra tracks, which explains why it&amp;rsquo;s an exhausting seventeen tracks long. &amp;ldquo;Lights&amp;rdquo; was a successful debut and a few of the singles went top 20, which is what led to its re-release with all those extra songs in November of the same year. (I think this is why it is in my collection, I think I bought it for my mum or for a sibling as part of a Christmas present, and ripped the CD out of curiosity&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is one of my more played Fabric mix CDs so I decided to go for it when my random prompter plumped for this earlier today. One constraint of these posts was to write it in roughly the amount of time it takes to listen to it. You&amp;rsquo;d think that for a mix CD that would be ok. After all, this mix is a full CD and 74 minutes long.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How random should things be?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to extract my music library, including all the albums I&amp;rsquo;ve added to streaming, as a CSV file and write a routine in R to select an album at random. The plan is to write about that album for the blog in roughly the time that it takes to listen to that album all the way through. I already did this yesterday for &lt;a href=&#34;https://mattischrome.com/goldfrapp-black-cherry&#34;&gt;Goldfrapp&amp;rsquo;s Black Cherry.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I have to level with you. That was not the first album that was picked. Nor is the album selection process entirely unbiased. I got to a working situation and stopped there. Essentially, I smoosh together artist and album title, so that albums like compilations, or albums where the lead artist collaborates with multiple other artists, are slightly over-represented. I say slightly as the pool was already pretty large with just unique albums. I might do what I did yesterday and ignore singles or compilations, especially as the code takes almost zero time to give me another idea.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Goldfrapp - Black Cherry</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the first in an unplanned series of &lt;strong&gt;album revisits&lt;/strong&gt;, I will write a post explaining the process soon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Cherry_(Goldfrapp_album)&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Black Cherry&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; is the second album by Goldfrapp, released in 2003. I bought the lead single Train while I lived in York and also the single of the title track because by then I&amp;rsquo;d discovered M83 and they&amp;rsquo;d done a remix of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Black Cherry&amp;rdquo; finds the band faced with following their successful and chilled out debut album &amp;ldquo;Felt Mountain&amp;rdquo;, which back in 2000 had sounded notably weird. But nobody wants to sound like a kook forever, sometimes people want to let their hair down and just dance. That&amp;rsquo;s very much what the first two tracks anyway, especially the pulsating &amp;ldquo;Train&amp;rdquo;. To my ears, I was definitely pleased when I first played the single - I love that relentless synth riff that sounds like it&amp;rsquo;s being fed through about seventy FX pedals. I vaguely remember the single&amp;rsquo;s B-side &amp;ldquo;Big Black Cloud, Little White Lie&amp;rdquo; and the Village Hall Remix being pretty ace too. Fortunately they&amp;rsquo;re also on streaming, so I was able to check. I think I liked the B-side because it sounded very much like a &amp;ldquo;Felt Mountain&amp;rdquo; outtake - twenty years ago I likely appreciated the familiarity but today it serves a reminder that while &amp;ldquo;Felt Mountain 2&amp;rdquo; would have been nice, &amp;ldquo;Black Cherry&amp;rdquo; definitely benefitted from changing things up a bit. The Remix is mostly instrumental and adds even more Glitter beat stomp to Train, pleasant enough I guess.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
