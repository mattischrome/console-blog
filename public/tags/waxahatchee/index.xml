      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tiger&amp;rsquo;s Blood&amp;rdquo; is a glorious bundle of songs that writhe with brains and heart, with love and friendship, and many other complements and opposites. The music is mostly alternative AOR with a distinct country twang. The lyrics were pretty impenetrable to me, at least until I looked them up online (and they&amp;rsquo;re also on the back of the poster that came with the LP), but they&amp;rsquo;re mostly songs of hope and happiness. It was satisfying to listen to an album this care-free, even if there is a hint of darker times in the background.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
