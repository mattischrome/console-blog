      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ellen Gallagher is an American artist and her &amp;ldquo;AxME&amp;rdquo; show recently finished at the Tate Modern. I went along a few weeks ago and have only now had a bit of time to write up my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My biggest regret is that I didn&amp;rsquo;t go along to it sooner, so that I had a chance to see it more than once. It was certainly a larger show than I was expecting (it was about the size of the &lt;a href=&#34;ibrahim-el-salahi-at-tate-modern&#34;&gt;Ibrahim El-salahi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;choucair-at-tate-modern&#34;&gt;Saloua Choucair&lt;/a&gt; shows put together) and I hadn&amp;rsquo;t left myself with a lot of time to see everything when I did go.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
