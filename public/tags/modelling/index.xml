      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a follow-up to my post about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/euro-2016-panini-stickers/&#34;&gt;Euro 2016 Panini Stickers&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve now completed the collection with &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/swaptastic-part-1/&#34;&gt;the help of an online swapping site&lt;/a&gt; and by buying the last 39 stickers directly from Panini. I also managed to write a new simulator, this time with additional collectors involved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I assume that each of N collectors will buy a packet of stickers and add any new stickers to their album. Then they attempt to swap any leftovers with the rest of their friends. The intersect function in R makes this pretty easy to code up. Every collector who finishes the album stops buying stickers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Euro 2016 Panini Stickers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sound the conspicuous consumption klaxon! ðŸ“£ I know it&amp;rsquo;s foolish but I decided to collect the Panini stickers for the Euro 2016 tournament this summer. I think it&amp;rsquo;s a more edifying waste of money than a series of group game accumulators that don&amp;rsquo;t come off. If this week&amp;rsquo;s long read in The Guardian is anything to go by, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/31/big-gamble-dangerous-british-betting-shops&#34;&gt;we really shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be giving any more of our money to betting companies&lt;/a&gt;. The album also looks better than any of the official books. Anyway, this post celebrates my inner collector/geek and the beauty of the shiny sticker!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Mountain Story</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A cat reaches the top of a mountain after a long climb through the snow. He is cold from the bottom of his fur to the tips of his claws. He is sodden and wet, and we all know how much a cat hates to be wet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the top of the mountain there is not much to see. What may have been a breathtaking view is instead a murk of freezing mist and at any rate, snow assails the catâ€™s eyes and whiskers. He shivers and sneezes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time there was a man who loved to paint. He studied the art and craft of painting for many years. He chose to invest his time and energy into creating the most realistic portraits that he could paint. For him the joy came not from completing the paintings but the process of recreating the real world with the strokes of his brush.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For many years he continued to study the art of painting. He learned new techniques for abstracting from reality but he always favoured the realism above all else. Meanwhile, his friends and family mocked him and said that he would always be a poor boy who loved to paint but could not make money from it. He had no answer to this criticism, the satisfaction he gained from applying the brush to the canvas was to great to worry about whether his paintings would be finished or not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
