      <title>Personal Development Environment</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to settle on a text editor, IDE, and terminal for a long time now. Partly I&amp;rsquo;m limited by what I can use at work because I owe to myself and my colleagues to be able to reproduce all my skills in a work setting. However, part of me has also wandered off a bit after reading about the idea of a &amp;ldquo;personal Development Environment&amp;rdquo; (or PDE I guess, though in a former life that &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation&#34;&gt;meant something very different&lt;/a&gt;), which is essentially an application where you can do anything and have it configured exactly how you like. Here&amp;rsquo;s an update on my progress on that front:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Post Statistics, Part 2</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are some more stats about the blog after I ran out of time yesterday due to&#xA;data cleaning! This time I&amp;rsquo;ve taken the date of each post and extracted the&#xA;month and year. Then I added the number of posts in each month and the number of&#xA;words written. I had to left join on the complete time span between August 2010&#xA;and February 2025, filling in any NA values for the zeros that were missing&#xA;before I did that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Slots and Pipes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recent explorations in R have reminded me about two ways of thinking about how you refer to objects or (parts of objects) in the language.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Slots are probably what you learn about first, they use the &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; syntax. In R, the &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; operator is used to access specific elements or columns within a data structure, such as a list, data frame, or environment. You can think of it as an ersatz shorthand for the &lt;code&gt;tidyverse::select()&lt;/code&gt; function, except that the latter is more powerful because you can do funky things like selecting multiple columns programmatically. By programmatically I mean &amp;ldquo;in some way that is not predetermined until you run your code&amp;rdquo;, e.g. because you are selecting a subset of columns of your data frame that didn&amp;rsquo;t exist until (long) before that step. Anyway, back to &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s a way of selecting a particular column of a data frame or any smaller part of an object in R. In fact, one of my main use cases for &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; used to be for recalculating columns in a data frame when I wasn&amp;rsquo;t confident about using &lt;code&gt;mutate()&lt;/code&gt;: changing a column to a factor with &lt;code&gt;mutate()&lt;/code&gt; gave me the heebie-jeebies for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Little Lesson in R</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had to compute an indicator this week. It had confidence intervals that relied on taking 100,000 samples from the indicator&amp;rsquo;s approximate distribution. I had to repeat this over multiple GP practices and for twelve different demographic groups.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I decided to use &lt;code&gt;dplyr&lt;/code&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; because I thought it would help me organise all subgroups involved. I used &lt;a href=&#34;http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise_all.html&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mutate_at()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; heavily and thought that &lt;code&gt;dplyr&lt;/code&gt; was keeping everything organised. However, when I moved from the 10 samples I&amp;rsquo;d used for testing to the 100,000 samples required by the specification of the indicator, my code moved to a crawl. Fearing that my work laptop was a little puny, I left it running overnight on my Mac&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and by morning R was still holding up its infuriating little stop sign.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Personal ggplot tips and tweaks</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love making plots in R with &lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt;. However, there are always a few niggles that I forget about between plots. I wrote this post so that I have somewhere to look the next time I need to tweak a few things in my plots. I intend to come back and add updates in the future as I learn more things. If I keep coming back, I might also remember a few of these too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Swaptastic Part 3: The Shiny App</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/swaptastic-part-3/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The shiny app embedded below allows you to explore the number of packets you need to complete the Panini sticker album for this summer&amp;rsquo;s Euro tournament. This builds on the results I presented in an [earlier post](link to earlier post) and allows you to explore how many fewer packets you need to buy when you have more friends to swap with. You can also vary the number of runs performed because the model runs considerably slower with more swappers involved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a follow-up to my post about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/euro-2016-panini-stickers/&#34;&gt;Euro 2016 Panini Stickers&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve now completed the collection with &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/swaptastic-part-1/&#34;&gt;the help of an online swapping site&lt;/a&gt; and by buying the last 39 stickers directly from Panini. I also managed to write a new simulator, this time with additional collectors involved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I assume that each of N collectors will buy a packet of stickers and add any new stickers to their album. Then they attempt to swap any leftovers with the rest of their friends. The intersect function in R makes this pretty easy to code up. Every collector who finishes the album stops buying stickers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to generate random numbers in R</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/generate-random-numbers-in-r/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post deals with how to generate random numbers in R. It is good to know how to generate random numbers with a particular language or software package for at least one of the following three reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You want to test something that depends on a particular distribution.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You’re running a stochastic process of some kind (Branching process, random walk etc) and you need random numbers for deciding whether an event occurs.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You forgot to pick your lottery numbers this week.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let’s step through doing each of these with R. Over time I will write this post out again for C++, Java, Python, and Ruby. This post is just a memory aid that I can use later on and is not meant as anything more rigorous than that. As such it is a living document, I will mutate this post in place as and when I need to. Memory aids are useful for when you haven’t used a particular programming language or software package for a while. Who knows, it might save me a couple of searches with DuckDuckGo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
