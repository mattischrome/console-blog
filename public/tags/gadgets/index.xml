      <description>&lt;p&gt;Time for a little gear review. This is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/multi-device-keyboard-k380&#34;&gt;Logitech K380 keyboard&lt;/a&gt;. It pairs with devices wirelessly over Bluetooth. I bought it to use with my Apple TV, iPad and iPhone. It runs on 2 AAA batteries, but the supplied batteries are not rechargeable. The keyboard is light and portable but you definitely know you have it in your bag.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s lovely to type on. For a go-anywhere keyboard it has a surprisingly nice feel to the keys. It also gives equal weight to Windows and Mac keys, so it&amp;rsquo;s quite easy to use across both platforms. The only frustration is that the iPad doesn&amp;rsquo;t support keyboards as it should and the iPhone is even worse. I&amp;rsquo;m expecting that to change in iOS 10, which is due to be announced at WWDC next week. Of course, none of this is the fault of the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
