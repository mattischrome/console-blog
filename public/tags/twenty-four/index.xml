      <title>2024 Albums of the Year #1: Bolis Pupul, Letter To Yu</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bolispupul.bandcamp.com&#34;&gt;Bolis Pupul&lt;/a&gt; (the stage name of Boris Zeebroek) is an artist on &lt;a href=&#34;https://deew.ee/catalogue&#34;&gt;Soulwax&amp;rsquo;s Deewee label&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://deew.ee/catalogue/074&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Letter to Yu&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; is his debut album, inspired by a trip to Hong Kong to investigate his family history. It investigates themes of place, family, and identity. We are exposed to everywhere all at once but we&amp;rsquo;re also all &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; somewhere, even if it&amp;rsquo;s somewhere we might not recommend or understand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aside from the theme of the album, it&amp;rsquo;s a satisfying and varied electronic album. You have a pop song early on in &amp;ldquo;Completely Half&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;I thought that I / would fit right in / I&amp;rsquo;m on the border of the state I&amp;rsquo;m in&amp;rdquo;) but the rest of side one is fine electro, peaking with the frenetic &amp;ldquo;Doctor Says&amp;rdquo; and ebbing out with the ringing &amp;ldquo;Spicy Crab&amp;rdquo;. (I realised writing this that the vinyl omits &amp;ldquo;Frogs&amp;rdquo; from the streaming version, but this makes the vinyl version of the album better paced.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2024 Albums of the Year #2: Waxahatchee, Tigers Blood</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tiger&amp;rsquo;s Blood&amp;rdquo; is a glorious bundle of songs that writhe with brains and heart, with love and friendship, and many other complements and opposites. The music is mostly alternative AOR with a distinct country twang. The lyrics were pretty impenetrable to me, at least until I looked them up online (and they&amp;rsquo;re also on the back of the poster that came with the LP), but they&amp;rsquo;re mostly songs of hope and happiness. It was satisfying to listen to an album this care-free, even if there is a hint of darker times in the background.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2024 Albums of the Year #3: Acopia, Acopia</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Acopia are a band from Melbourne Australia with that time honoured line up of one girl and two guys. This eponymous album is their second and it&amp;rsquo;s full of slinky electronic ballads that echo classic 90s trip hop. It&amp;rsquo;s got that same downtempo downbeat vibe, the sorts of songs that revel in sadness but also the joy of a killer bass line.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This album was actually released in November 2023 but I first heard it in January 2024 after reading a glowing review of it. I can remember the first time listening to it, I took the train to see my parents in to hand over a present I&amp;rsquo;d bought for my nephew. (Fittingly, it&amp;rsquo;s his birthday today.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2024 Albums of the Year #4: Adrianne Lenker, Bright Future</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One album that&amp;rsquo;s lurking in the periphery of my &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;understated classics series&lt;/a&gt; is &amp;ldquo;Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe In You&amp;rdquo; by Big Thief. &amp;ldquo;Bright Future&amp;rdquo; is the latest solo album by Big Thief singer-songwriter Adrianne Lenker and it is just as good. Intimate and intricate, it draws the listener in as Adrianne sings live with a very small band. At times you can hear breaths drawn and the sound feels like a small space that you are cocooned in: this could be sound engineering (spatial audio would have us believe anything is possible) but it&amp;rsquo;s most likely equipment set up intelligently in a cosy studio.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s interesting that an album sung entirely in Italian ended up being one of my favourites of the year, but perhaps not surprising given well written and arranged these songs are. They&amp;rsquo;re just the right side of electro-pop but also with an air of sophistication.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t speak Italian but I do speak some romance languages, so I can sort of guess what the titles might mean. &amp;ldquo;La Notte&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;The Night&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Il Bucchi Neri&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;The Black Holes&amp;rdquo; (I&amp;rsquo;d thought it was the black mouths but I guess I was close!), and so on. As the for the lyrics, they&amp;rsquo;re catching enough for me to sing a phonetic version of them to myself on many occasions, though I&amp;rsquo;ve no idea what meaning I&amp;rsquo;ve been mangling!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What do you think of when you think of the colour blue? The sea? Perhaps the sky? Maybe it makes you think of blue stones like sapphires, or flowers such as forget-me-nots? Maybe the colour blue is the glow of a phone screen on someone&amp;rsquo;s face (maybe yours) in the dark? Blue gathers at the edges of the harsh white LED light that has come to dominate our night time existence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2024 Albums of the Year #7: MGMT, Loss Of Life</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2024-albums-07-mgmt-loss-of-life/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know very much about MGMT these days. I haven&amp;rsquo;t read any interviews about their albums. The video to the single &amp;ldquo;Nothing to Declare&amp;rdquo; was brought to my attention by the YouTube channel Justin Hawkins Rides Again. In it he points out how melodically interesting the song is. To be honest I was more than a little bit in love with the video.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After that I added the album to my library and heard a few more singles in the run up to the release of the album, including &amp;ldquo;Bubblegum Dog&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Mother Nature&amp;rdquo;. The album itself is crammed with similarly interesting songs and has a circular structure, beginning with part 2 of the title track. I&amp;rsquo;d love to know what poem is being read or sampled or cut up on &amp;ldquo;Loss of Life, Pt. 2&amp;rdquo;. Other highlights include &amp;ldquo;Phradie&amp;rsquo;s Song&amp;rdquo; and a song called &amp;ldquo;Nothing Changes&amp;rdquo; which goes a bot bonkers in the second half, completely undermining the title of the song!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2024 Albums of the Year #8: Pet Shop Boys Nonetheless</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2024-albums-08-pet-shop-boys-nonetheless/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2024-albums-08-pet-shop-boys-nonetheless/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless is the fifteenth album by the Pet Shop Boys. As seems to be a common theme with this top 10 so far, it&amp;rsquo;s an album that initially underwhelmed me. Well, perhaps &amp;ldquo;underwhelmed&amp;rdquo; is a little unfair, it was more that it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have much to it to distinguish it from their previous albums, and there have been some palpable duds in the previous fourteen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, this album is definitely a grower. As I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten to know some of the songs, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to appreciate the little details strewn throughout. For example, the lovely little rave riff that breaks into the bridge on &amp;ldquo;Loneliness&amp;rdquo;, something that turns a potentially stern song into something a lot more fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first time I listened to this album, I was still off work sick with Covid, but well enough to go out for a walk on what was too hot a day to stay inside the house. I remember it well, recovering from illness does tend to make these things more vivid, but more because I thought it was brilliant, but all out of order. I was, of course, completely wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2024 Albums of the Year #10: Yard Act, Where&#39;s My Utopia?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yard Act are a post-punk band from Leeds. &amp;ldquo;Where&amp;rsquo;s My Utopia?&amp;rdquo; is their second album. I first encountered Yard Act in a review of this album, which sent me to look at the excellent video to their non-album single &amp;ldquo;The Trenchcoat Museum&amp;rdquo;. I enjoyed the metatextual references both in the video and the song, so I eagerly added &amp;ldquo;Where&amp;rsquo;s My Utopia?&amp;rdquo; to my library.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the album took a while to win me over. Fourth-wall breaking asides and meta references are fine in a single song, even one as long as &amp;ldquo;The Trenchcoat Museum&amp;rdquo;, but combined over the length of a whole album, it can be a bit off-putting. Nevertheless, WMU? rewards repeat listens (especially on headphones) because it&amp;rsquo;s genuinely funny - I think comedy is an underrated quality in Indie music - and the songs themselves are ace.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A nice feature I added to this blog in its recent update was a &lt;a href=&#34;https://mattischrome.com/tags/&#34;&gt;tags page&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of this &lt;a href=&#34;https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/how-to-get-a-tags-page/24213/4&#34;&gt;very useful discourse thread&lt;/a&gt; and some additional CSS tweaks, the resulting page is something that I am very happy with. It lists all of the tags that apply to any post, along with the number of posts with that tag, in alphabetical order. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly intended as a guide for you the reader, to help you see whether your preoccupations match my own.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bob Mortimer, The Satsuma Complex</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A hardback book called &amp;ldquo;The Satsuma Complex&amp;rdquo; is all that remains of a mysterious young lady that young lawyer Gary is chatting up in the pub one night. It&amp;rsquo;s a book that everyone reckons is &amp;ldquo;a bit sh*t&amp;rdquo;. But Gary&amp;rsquo;s moping about after the Satsuma lady doing a runner while he was in the loo will have to be put on hold when his friend turns up dead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed this book. It&amp;rsquo;s not going to win any prizes for quality of writing but it is both fun and funny. There are a few repetitive phrases and at one point beers magically become lagers in the space of three paragraphs. The writing is very colloquial but there is a point-of-view shift at the start of part two that deploys some writerly skill. (This short-lived though as the new point-of-view soon collapses down into one similar to the main character.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the new look for my blog. I&amp;rsquo;ve had my eye on a more minimal look for a while now. Whether this new look is successful or not depends on how often I write new posts. To that end, this theme also supports a separate (or almost separate) stream of photos. Once I&amp;rsquo;ve got back in to the habit of putting photos up, that should be a nice additional stream of content.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, a cat named Nerys ripped into the bottom of our sofa to make herself a cozy burrow. This was all well and good, except for the times when she would do it when we were using the sofa too. On these occasions (and presumably on most others) she would proceed to sharpen her claws on what remained of the fabric. (A less charitable reason for this behaviour would be that she was simply widening the whole for her future self after eating more and more kibbles!)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things that people tend to start around this time of year is a diary. They usually get filled for as long as your new year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions last.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing in my current diary for a while. It&amp;rsquo;s a Moleskine extra large ruled Notebook in beautiful Prussian Blue, covered in whatever stickers pass over my desk. (Hint: find my address and send me stickers Internet.) This is much more preferable to a &amp;lsquo;real&amp;rsquo; diary because I can leave a few days and then resume. I can also take breaks and write out a bunch of notes on Org-mode or the Julia programming language if I want to (and yes, I did).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theverge.com/c/23998379/google-search-seo-algorithm-webpage-optimization&#34;&gt;an excellent article on The Verge yesterday about how Google is transforming the kinds of sites and blogs that are on the internet&lt;/a&gt;. I also read &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/where-have-all-the-websites-gone/&#34;&gt;this slightly more personal take by Jason Velasquez&lt;/a&gt;, which is more about how social networks have gobbled up all the time and attention of people who might otherwise be making interesting web sites. This has made me think deeply about what this blog is &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt;, and why I might continue to blog in Twenty Twenty Four.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Well dear reader I managed to! It arrived today from the Netherlands with minimal fuss. It sounds great and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure whether my review did it justice: that&amp;rsquo;s the problem with attempting to (re-)review ten albums in ten days with Christmas and New Year all happening at the same time!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Future Matt,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Always look up instructions for what you want to do in the Git documentation. It&amp;rsquo;s dry but it&amp;rsquo;s good. In a pinch, look at Stack Overflow. Don&amp;rsquo;t ask Chat-GPT for advice on Git problems!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;To reverse mistakes, consult the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohshitgit.com&#34;&gt;Oh Shit Git&lt;/a&gt; website.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;To make things easier, delete the remote to your Github repository and then add it (the remote) back again. This is so much easier than the alternative.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Best wishes,&#xA;Past Matt (with his annual flash of January git confidence).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Here is photographic evidence:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../../assets/images/2023/cologne-proof.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Photographic evidence of my visit to Cologne&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We took the Eurostar via Brussels. A bit of a long day on the way back but much less stressful compared to flying.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We went to the Isle of Wight in June. It was the first time I&amp;rsquo;d been since I was about 8. This time I didn&amp;rsquo;t get Chicken Pox. Anyway, here is photographic evidence:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2023 Albums: Honourable Mentions</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/2023-albums-honourable-mentions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A quick list of ten other albums I considered to be among the best of last year. I either listened to these less, or in the cases of &amp;ldquo;Transmission Three&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Be Opened By The Wonderful&amp;rdquo; considered them to be ineligible as they are compilations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;yves-tumor-praise-a-lord-who-chews-but-which-does-not-consume-or-simply-hot-between-worlds&#34;&gt;Yves Tumor, &amp;ldquo;Praise a Lord Who Chews but Which Does Not Consume; (Or Simply, Hot Between Worlds)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Great album, recommended to me by Apple Music slinging the first track into my discovery feed back when that featured was added. Lots of earworms and a really good headphone listen. My top 10 was pretty dance heavy and putting this in might have added a few more guitars. Highly recommended.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
