    <p>I find it hard to get started on projects. This may have always been the case. I definitely remember instances of complex plans for school projects that I&rsquo;d barely have time to finish. I once got up at 6AM to finish making a calendar in French—I thought it was going to be this outstanding piece of work that would genuinely replace my teacher&rsquo;s calendar! Reality didn&rsquo;t quite match the idea though.</p>

    <p>Feb. 26, 2022</p>
    <p>The Imaginary Girlfriend is a short autobiography by American author John Irving. In it, he explains the interwoven roles of writing and wrestling in his life.
As always with Irving, the book is absorbing from the off, and it&rsquo;s tempting to use the anecdotes here to explain why most of his novels seem to have an underdog narrating them. It&rsquo;s because he loves the work of Dickens so much. I kid.</p>

    <p>Feb. 8, 2022</p>
    <p>Today I had an interesting bug in some Latex code I am writing. Putting a footnote into a caption caused the document to fail compilation. The problem was that this document doesn&rsquo;t use a table of figures at the start, so I hadn&rsquo;t thought to include a short summary caption. Apparently the curly brace in the footnote command does not sit well with that, even if you aren&rsquo;t using a list or table of figures in your document.</p>

    <p>Feb. 8, 2022</p>
    <p>&lsquo;Civilisations&rsquo; is a counterfactual historical novel that attempts to extrapolate the future course of history after changing one pivotal moment of the timeline. I usually find novels like this are great fun, another entertaining example is &lsquo;Making History&rsquo; by Stephen Fry. The novel, originally written in French, won some big awards in France last year. I read the translation by Sam Taylor.
In &lsquo;Civilisations&rsquo;, Binet makes the pivotal point of his tale, the migration of Erik the Red to America in the late 900s.</p>

    <p>Feb. 5, 2022</p>
    <p>Today, we transferred our Christmas tree to a new pot. Being root-bound as the tree was, it took ages to get it out of the crappy pot from the store and into the new, bigger pot. And I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s a bit wonky, which might make the baubles a bit lopsided next Christmas. It looks excellent next to the new bird bath.
Nonetheless, it was nice to get another plant into a pot with the hope of keeping it around.</p>

    <p>Feb. 4, 2022</p>
    <p>Lifeforms is the 1994 album from the Future Sound of London. A double album (just), it also features the talents of Robert Fripp, Ozric Tentacles, Talvin Singh, Toni Halliday, and Liz Frazer. It reached number 6 on the UK album chart and went silver.
I have wanted to write about the Lifeforms album for a long time. In 2012, I even tried learning how to tell the tracks apart from one another.</p>

    <p>Feb. 3, 2022</p>
    <p>At the moment I can’t compile this blog locally because my ruby-ffi install is somehow wrong and is preventing Jekyll from running on my recently upgraded Mac system. Fortunately the site still compiles on Netlify, or else you wouldn’t be reading this!
It’s always annoying when you rely on a complex multi-part system and some obscure part fails. It leaves you groping for answers and inventing unnecessary hack solutions. The dreaded old Stack Overflow rabbit hole.</p>

    <p>Despite my best intentions, I didn’t manage to continue writing posts after the first day of 2022! But perhaps now I can try again as an excuse to test my blogging set up on my new computer.</p>

    <p>Feb. 2, 2022</p>
    <p>Hmmm it seems as though the ffi gem as installed by bundler is not compatible with a Mac that has an M1 chip. This limits my ability to preview blog posts locally. I might have to swap to a more modern static site generator (which is probably easier than working out what ffi actually does) - seems like a good February project!</p>

    <p>Jan. 1, 2022</p>
    <p>At the new year, thoughts and spare time for writing point me toward writing some new posts for my understated classics series. Expect some new ones soon.
I also reflected on my previous choices and thought a bit about how my music tastes have changed recently. Some of this has to do with streaming and the frustrations I wrote about in my last post. Some of it is just down to getting older: I have less time to listen to new music, and much of the &rsquo;new&rsquo; stuff I listen to is me investigating the stuff I missed first time around.</p>

    <p>How hard is it to just listen to music these days?
Spotify has crammed in all sorts of crap in to the app lately. Lyric videos, those weird interactive art things that are turned on by default, podcasts (so many podcasts), Netflix tie-ins, and audiobooks. It wants to be the app that opens when you plug in your headphones (not that we’ll be doing that for much longer the way things are going).</p>

    <p>Today I listened to &lsquo;Cloudbusting&rsquo; by Kate Bush for the first time in a while. What a gloriously strange song it is. Best of all, it&rsquo;s one of those songs that obscures what it is really about. It&rsquo;s not a song about a change in the weather, but about Wilhelm Reich, the orgone accumulator, fluorescent yo-yos, and a son (rather than a sun) coming out.
&lsquo;Cloudbusting&rsquo; is from &lsquo;Hounds of Love&rsquo;, Kate&rsquo;s &lsquo;comeback&rsquo; album following the commercial failure of &lsquo;The Dreaming&rsquo;, an album I wrote about in my understated classics series.</p>
