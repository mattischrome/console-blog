    <p>Aug. 31, 2016</p>
    <p>As I mentioned in yesterday&rsquo;s post, I allowed Spotify to pick some new albums for me this month. It chose some noodly ambient techno, a captivating slice of World Jazz, a moody gothic hallucination, and a concept album about humans being rescued by aliens. All in all a pretty good job! Here is the list:
Prins Thomas &ldquo;Principe del Norte&rdquo; Sarathy Korwar &ldquo;Day to Day&rdquo; Doomsquad &ldquo;Total Time&rdquo; United Vibrations &ldquo;The Myth of the Golden Ratio&rdquo; Prins Thomas &ldquo;Principe del Norte&rdquo; Prins Thomas recently remixed the Orb&rsquo;s &ldquo;Alpine EP&rdquo; so I&rsquo;m not surprised that Spotify included one of his tracks on my Discover Weekly playlist.</p>

    <p>Aug. 30, 2016</p>
    <p>Because I couldn&rsquo;t find any albums coming out this month that I wanted to review for the album digest, I decided to let Spotify pick the albums to listen to. I listened to my algorithmically chosen Discover Weekly playlist one week and selected albums based on the songs that I liked the most. The album also had to be released in 2016. The selections are ones that got away.
I&rsquo;ve done this before.</p>

    <p>Aug. 21, 2016</p>
    <p>We went to see Prom 47, an afternoon prom at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The bill included a brand new work by Piers Hellawell, along with a Cello concerto by Haydn and a symphony by Tchaikovsky. These were all performed by the Ulster Orchestra. The conductor was Rafael Payare. The tickets were an affordable Â£17 each which isn&rsquo;t bad at all given that we were sat in the second row of the circle.</p>

    <p>Jul. 31, 2016</p>
    <p>Album Digest July 2016 consists of a bumper five albums, mainly because I couldn&rsquo;t work out which one to drop. I think they&rsquo;re all pretty good though it&rsquo;s great to hear new music from The Avalanches after all this time.
Bat For Lashes &ldquo;The Bride&rdquo; For her fourth album as Bat For Lashes, Natasha Khan applies her considerable songwriting skills to a concept album. She sings from the perspective of a bride whose husband dies on his way to their wedding.</p>

    <p>Jul. 30, 2016</p>
    <p>Acts of the Assassins is an interesting novel by Richard Beard that retells the story of the apostles and their deaths. It uses a modern crime genre style and a contemporary setting. The author himself refers to it as &ldquo;Gospel Noir&rdquo;. Cassius Gallio, a Roman CSI-type referred to as a speculator, investigates the murders of the apostles following the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus. Gallio, charged with guarding the body following Jesus&rsquo; death and greatly undermined by the disappearance of the body, views the resurrection as the greatest conspiracy of the age.</p>

    <p>Jul. 20, 2016</p>
    <p>I give the impression of planning these posts but to be honest I came across an article about Maxwell a few weeks ago and fondly remembered my cassette copy of this album. The joy of Spotify is that it&rsquo;s easy to dig up old favourites. The recent warm weather makes for a good opportunity to enjoy the sultry embrace of &ldquo;Embrya&rdquo; once more.
&ldquo;Gestation: Mythos&rdquo; burbles along for two and a half minutes, overlaying spoken word samples, string phrases and weird underwater noises, before the bass line of &ldquo;Everwanting: To Want You To Want&rdquo; brings things to life.</p>

    <p>Uyuni to Tupiza We left Uyuni the night after the big storm, having stopped just a day or so to visit the salt flats. Our next stop was a strategic stay in Tupiza, a large town encircled with red hills. It resembled many towns that I visited in South America: low buildings arranged in a grid pattern. Not much greenery and plenty of dust billowing about. The reason for our stay was strategic, it&rsquo;s only a short distance to the notoriously fussy border between Bolivia and Argentina.</p>

    <p>Jul. 14, 2016</p>
    <p>I last wrote about a JG Ballard novel nearly three years ago. That one - &ldquo;High-Rise&rdquo; - has since been made into a film. The subject of this post is &ldquo;The Unlimited Dream Company&rdquo;, my favourite among his novels: a silly romp through suburban sexual repression that glitters with sinister wit. Even after many read-throughs I still can&rsquo;t work out whether it is a crazy masterpiece or something light that we&rsquo;re meant to throw away after reading.</p>

    <p>Jul. 1, 2016</p>
    <p>The shiny app embedded below allows you to explore the number of packets you need to complete the Panini sticker album for this summer&rsquo;s Euro tournament. This builds on the results I presented in an [earlier post](link to earlier post) and allows you to explore how many fewer packets you need to buy when you have more friends to swap with. You can also vary the number of runs performed because the model runs considerably slower with more swappers involved.</p>

    <p>Jun. 30, 2016</p>
    <p>Album Digest June 2016 is a poppy batch of albums. We have the return of my long-time favourites Roxette and the heroes of my South American tour Tegan &amp; Sara. There&rsquo;s some dance music in the form of Flume&rsquo;s album &ldquo;Skin&rdquo;: an Australian presence ahead of the new Avalanches album next month. Finally there is the first of two new albums by Islands - both were released back in May but one gets reviewed this month and the other next month.</p>

    <p>As a follow-up to my post about the Euro 2016 Panini Stickers, I&rsquo;ve now completed the collection with the help of an online swapping site and by buying the last 39 stickers directly from Panini. I also managed to write a new simulator, this time with additional collectors involved.
I assume that each of N collectors will buy a packet of stickers and add any new stickers to their album. Then they attempt to swap any leftovers with the rest of their friends.</p>

    <p>Jun. 25, 2016</p>
    <p>Britain voted to leave the EU this week. It made for an angry and confused Friday morning. I posted snippy comments on Facebook at a rate of about one every fifteen minutes. I also knew that there was nothing I could do. Even when you feel like Charlton Heston at the end of &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;, you have to suck it up and accept that sometimes things don't go as you like.</p>
