      <description>&amp;ldquo;Something Coming Through&amp;rdquo; is a science fiction novel set in the near future. A few years after a brief nuclear war known as &amp;ldquo;The Spasm&amp;rdquo;, an alien race known as the Jackaroo introduce themselves to humanity. The novel is funny, thoughtful, and politically charged. I found it to be a good read.&#xA;The aliens have given humanity fifteen &amp;ldquo;gift&amp;rdquo; worlds and an automated way to access them. Think of the Docklands Light Railway but with space shuttles.</description>
