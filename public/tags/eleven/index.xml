      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some rather brief pen pictures of this month’s albums. I’ve been a bit busy!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;radio-slave---collected-remixes&#34;&gt;Radio Slave - Collected Remixes&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thud thud thud. This is pretty much how all Radio Slave remixes go. I really liked his fabric mix and borrowed a few tracks for a playlist I made called &amp;ldquo;Dancing In Space&amp;rdquo;. Anyway, back to the thudding: it’s no bad thing, the remixes have a nice formula that works well for discovering new tracks like UNKLE’s &lt;em&gt;Burn My Shadow&lt;/em&gt; (Ian Astbury’s vocal is given plenty of room to shine) and K3’s &lt;em&gt;Play To Win&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My earliest memory is waking up in Queen Alexandra hospital in Cosham after an operation on my ears. I must have been about four years old and it was the middle of the night. I was in a room on my own and the door was locked. It had been daylight only seconds before so I got out of the bed and walked to the window to look incredulously out at the amber world that lay beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just three albums this month as I’ve been listening to a lot of Brian Eno records ready for an upcoming understated classic. First up is &lt;em&gt;50 Words For Snow&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Kate Bush&lt;/strong&gt;, the second album that she has released this year. &lt;a href=&#34;album-digest-may-2011&#34;&gt;Back in May&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about &lt;em&gt;Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt;, which presented re-recorded and re-mastered versions of songs from her albums &lt;em&gt;The Sensual World&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Red Shoes&lt;/em&gt;. This time around it is an album of brand new material, the first since &lt;em&gt;Aerial&lt;/em&gt; in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understated Classics #14: Clear by Bomb The Bass</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think it’s time to discuss your philosophy of drug use as it relates to artistic endeavour…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That quote is from the movie “The Naked Lunch” directed by David Cronenburg (see also &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/crash/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;) and it also opens “Bug Powder Dust” by Bomb The Bass, the five star single that opens “Clear”. A rollicking piece of rock rap dripping with pop culture references that runs for four and half minutes and does not stop until another quote from “The Naked Lunch”, it is probably one of my favourite songs of the 90s. That churning guitar line sends me right back.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Contagion: A Short Review</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There was much excitement about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1598778/&#34;&gt;Contagion&lt;/a&gt; at work. Finally a movie that explains  as part of the plot! A bunch of us went to see it, mainly to see whether &lt;a href=&#34;http://contagionmovie.warnerbros.com/index.html&#34;&gt;a disaster movie about a global pandemic&lt;/a&gt; could hold up as entertainment and to have a bit of a giggle if it couldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I liked three things in particular about the film. I liked the cinematography, especially the opening sequences with the index cases staggering around. I liked the soundtrack except for when it intruded a bit too much into proceedings. Finally, I liked Marion Cotillard, who seems to be in every interesting movie at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Mark Rowlands, The Philosopher And The Wolf</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I saw that a friend had ‘liked’ this book on Facebook and reading about it on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Philosopher-Wolf-Lessons-Death-Happiness/dp/1847081029/&#34;&gt;amazon&lt;/a&gt;, I was curious enough to give it a go. It is the autobiography of the philosopher &lt;a href=&#34;http://rowlands.philospot.com/&#34;&gt;Mark Rowlands&lt;/a&gt;, specifically the experiences and lessons learned from raising a wolf, Brenin, from cub to maturity and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The book addresses different aspects of philosophy including the nature of evil and the interaction between humans and other animals. As you might expect, the book pays particular attention to our interactions with wolves and dogs. There is also a lot of explanation of the difference between wolves and dogs. Rowlands appears often to disparage dogs, though remembering my experiences of our Labradors while growing up did make me nod in agreement quite often.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This month we have albums by Björk, Coldplay, M83, and Radiohead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;album-digest-october-2011---intro&#34;&gt;Album Digest October 2011 - Intro&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I listened to Wilco’s &lt;em&gt;The Whole Love&lt;/em&gt; again the other day. I happened to be walking past the venue in Portsmouth where I went to see them live back in 2004 and it seemed the right fit. I really enjoyed the album after a period of not having listened to it and I found that being familiar with the songs allowed me to better appreciate the production of the album. It really is better than I had said last time when I included it in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/2011/09/album-digest-september-2011/&#34;&gt;September Album Digest&lt;/a&gt;, I suppose that it was the danger in writing about music you have only had with you for a few weeks (or days in the case of &lt;em&gt;The Whole Love&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hmmm, a rather grey looking selection of covers this month. The albums I have listened to most are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;John Beltran &lt;em&gt;Ambient Selections&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;FabricLive 59 mixed by Four Tet&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Rapture &lt;em&gt;In The Grace Of Your Love&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Wilco &lt;em&gt;The Whole Love&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have actually only had the Wilco album since Monday of this week (the 26th) but it has inveigled its way into my consciousness quite quickly. As I have said before, &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/2010/playlist-1-metallic/&#34;&gt;this blog owes its name to a Wilco song&lt;/a&gt; and they are quite an important band to me. The other albums are mostly electronic, although The Rapture are distinctly indie flavoured as they hit the dance floor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Frank Herbert, Dune</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A week or so ago, I finished reading &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; by Frank Herbert. It tells the story of a revolution within a Galactic Empire that takes place on a harsh and unforgiving desert planet called Arrakis. One central theme is how destinies can be shaped despite being intertwined around many axes. Another is the importance of adaptation in the fight for survival.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I came to &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; via the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087182/&#34;&gt;David Lynch film&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert%27s_Dune&#34;&gt;the Sci-Fi Channel’s mini-series&lt;/a&gt;, which I was able to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lovefilm.com/film/Dune-Part-1/161663/&#34;&gt;stream through LoveFilm&lt;/a&gt;. Of the two filmed versions, I found the latter to be more enjoyable and this is almost certainly because it runs to nearly six hours. The 1984 film runs to over 3 hours and yet still feels rather rushed. The Lynch version is to be praised though as in my opinion it develops a unique aesthetic for the Dune universe that I did not detect so much in the book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understated Classics #13: U.F.Orb by The Orb</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/understated-classics-13/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FUN FACT:&lt;/strong&gt; It was because of the artwork to this album that I obsessively scrawled onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome on my pencil case at school. I also had a very passable u.f.orb logo drawn on it too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-the-blue-room&#34;&gt;In The Blue Room&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had my first “close encounter” with The Orb in 1992 when the single &lt;em&gt;Blue Room&lt;/em&gt; was in the charts. Back then, as I &lt;a href=&#34;uc2&#34;&gt;mentioned previously&lt;/a&gt;, I would listen to the radio a lot and this tune - introduced as the longest single ever to enter the UK chart - struck me as really interesting. The radio edit was a burbling wash of synths and female vocals underpinned by a hefty bass performance from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newstatesman.com/music/2008/06/wobble-life-music-dub-leaving&#34;&gt;Jah Wobble&lt;/a&gt;. Incidentally, the same week that &lt;em&gt;Blue Room&lt;/em&gt; entered the chart, I was actually listening out for &lt;em&gt;Sentinel&lt;/em&gt; by Mike Oldfield and this single (&lt;a href=&#34;uc10&#34;&gt;from Tubular Bells II&lt;/a&gt;) featured two remixes by The Orb.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I bought a collection of electronic music this month. I mixed them all up in a smart playlist on iTunes, the smart aspect being to limit to tracks that had been played fewer than five then six then seven times etc. This made sure I was still listening to all the tracks equally often, despite the randomness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Biosphere &lt;em&gt;N-plants&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ford &amp;amp; Lopatin &lt;em&gt;Channel Pressure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Gus Gus &lt;em&gt;Arabian Horse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Instra:Mental &lt;em&gt;Resolution 653&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Jon Tejada &lt;em&gt;Parabolas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;biosphere-n-plants&#34;&gt;Biosphere &lt;em&gt;N-Plants&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think this album makes Biosphere the most reviewed musician on this blog at the moment but I don’t mind too much, he makes some great stuff. &lt;em&gt;N-Plants&lt;/em&gt; is a series of pieces about Japanese nuclear power plants and was ready for release by about February this year, just before the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster&#34;&gt;Fukishima nuclear disaster&lt;/a&gt; in March. It ended up being released in June. I am not sure if this represents a delay or not but as this quote shows, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.touchmusic.org.uk/catalogue/to84_biosphere_nplants.html&#34;&gt;Geir Jenssen is aware of how spooky the timing was&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;happy-birthday&#34;&gt;Happy Birthday!&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No matter how intellectual one gets about these things, the primary function of music is to have fun. With this in mind it is a good time to turn to Roxette then, as they are almost always the epitome of fun.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I received &lt;em&gt;Look Sharp!&lt;/em&gt; as a present for my ninth birthday. This was probably a bit young to fully understand all the emotions expressed on the record. It’s just as well that it is also crammed with the kind of pop confections that made &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Bore_Us,_Get_to_the_Chorus!&#34;&gt;“Don’t bore us, get to the chorus!”&lt;/a&gt; something of a band motto and made for a great introduction to the world of pop for a nine year old boy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Five lessons from a year of blogging</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/five-lessons-from-a-year-of-blogging/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 05 Aug 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/five-lessons-from-a-year-of-blogging/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have now been writing decent length articles on this site for about a year. I have learned a lot in this time, mostly about writing but also how to express your feelings and how to marshal your ideas and passions into action. For this month’s “five on the fifth”, I would like to share  with you some of the things I have learned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing posts consistently is hard…&lt;/strong&gt; There are a lot of things that get in the way of regular posting. Sometimes it is ambition undermines me, I have ideas for posts that are easy to think up that turn out to be much harder to actually write. Other times life does just get in the way, it is  a time-consuming activity to write five hundred or more words every day. I like to write posts out longhand before typing them up. I often find mistakes or horrible phrasing when I do this and often what seemed like a simple matter of typing something up becomes a bit of a mission. Of course, there are times when I am just lazy or uninspired.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;…except when it is easy.&lt;/strong&gt; I discovered early on that having a few arcs through the posts was a good idea as it makes you think a few in advance about what to do next. I prefer to be a generalist but it is nice to have the movie reviews, the &lt;a href=&#34;understated-classics&#34;&gt;understated classics&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;j-g-ballard&#34;&gt;JG Ballard&lt;/a&gt; novels to fall back on. Truth be told I am a little bored of Ballard now but even if I retire that particular strand of posts (Spoiler: Don’t worry, &lt;em&gt;High-Rise&lt;/em&gt; is on the way soon) I can always resume it later. Meanwhile, I can pad out the off days with some quotes or some photos.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easier to read is easier to write.&lt;/strong&gt; I hope that the blog is easier to read now than when I started. I still find myself producing the odd clunky phrase now and then but the number of passive sentences is decreasing. The unexpected benefit of this has been that I find it easier to check earlier posts in search for inspiration about what to write next. Early on, I would often end up editing old posts into something more comprehensible instead of writing new material. The “After the Deadline” feature of &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jetpack/&#34;&gt;Jetpack for WordPress&lt;/a&gt; has been very helpful in training me to write better.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WordPress is a lot of fun.&lt;/strong&gt; The statistic is that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wordpress.org/&#34;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; now powers about 500 million websites. It is not hard to see why, it is easy to install, easy to customise to suit to your tastes and most of all, it rewards you for continuing to produce content. I have installed all sorts of plug-ins, including a &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-word-count/&#34;&gt;word count plug-in&lt;/a&gt; that tells me that I have (up to this post) written a total of 89,032 published words. &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_a_novel&#34;&gt;If Wikipedia is to be believed&lt;/a&gt;, that is about the length of a pretty long novel. At least now I know I could write a novel in a year even if it was a rather surreal one featuring a 10K run, spiders and an Apatosaurus.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I still have a lot more to do, a lot more to learn.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;2017-update&#34;&gt;2017 Update&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Adding to this footnote some years later (2017) I realise that not all blog posts are permanent. Sometimes you write what you need to at the time and then take it down later. We don&amp;rsquo;t have to be permanently changed by what we once wrote on a Wednesday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quite a mixed bag this month.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;SBTRKT &lt;em&gt;SBTRKT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Zomby &lt;em&gt;Dedication&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Brian Eno &lt;em&gt;Drums Between The Bells&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bon Iver &lt;em&gt;Bon Iver&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Washed Out &lt;em&gt;Within and Without&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This month’s collection of albums is a rather mellow bunch. The SBTRKT album (self-titled) is probably the most frenetic of the five though even that does not exactly pound four to the floor. Most of it is pretty calm, though  the occasional burst of pop to spice things up: sometimes it is as downtempo as the rest (&lt;em&gt;Right Thing To Do&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Trials Of The Past&lt;/em&gt;) but at other times things spark into life, as on &lt;em&gt;Pharaohs&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It gets draining and upsetting, and leaves you fearful of what might come next.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You won’t need me to tell you about the tragedies that have occurred all over the world in the last few days: drought in East Africa, the gunman running amok in Norway, the death of Amy Winehouse and the horrific train crash in China.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understated Classics #11: Second Toughest In The Infants by Underworld</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;your-rails-your-fins-your-thin-paper-wings&#34;&gt;Your rails, your fins, your thin paper wings&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Second Toughest in the Infants&lt;/em&gt; (STITI) is the second album by Underworld, released in 1995. This was just ahead of the mania caused by the .NUXX version of Born Slippy appearing on the &lt;em&gt;Trainspotting&lt;/em&gt; soundtrack a little later. &lt;em&gt;Born Slippy&lt;/em&gt; itself, the blippy techno confection released between their début &lt;em&gt;Dubnobasswithmyheadman&lt;/em&gt; and this album. STITI then is very much the calm before the storm and features a band (in the truest sense, which is unusual among electronic acts) in full flow. The sure hands are apparent from the off with the all-in-one trifecta of &lt;em&gt;Juanita&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Kiteless&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;To Dream of Love&lt;/em&gt;: a huge slab of a track that propels, mashes and then glides over various tempos in its sixteen minute run.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Beta Test Of Everything</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading a few articles about the recent launch of Google+, a few things hit home. Google tends to launch a product that works and not always one that is perfect or finished (like, say, Apple). Sometimes it takes them several iterations to get right. They love the beta tag. In fact, I think it was Google (or possibly Flickr) that made me aware of the concept of beta software.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Along these line I thought about this blog and its one year anniversary. I take a similar approach here to posts on this blog, specifically in pushing out new categories now and then. I have done this in the hope that adding a new subject or thread will lead to me writing more posts. Currently I am averaging ten posts a month, which is not too bad.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why I Love The Jungle Book</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just as with the &lt;a href=&#34;understated-classics&#34;&gt;understated classics&lt;/a&gt; I want to set out my stall early on that good movies are good enough. Both &lt;a href=&#34;why-i-love-betty-blue&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Betty Blue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and today’s choice &lt;em&gt;The Jungle Book&lt;/em&gt; are never going to win any sort of consensus prize for the best movies ever made but they are really good. They also have a personal history attached that makes them worth writing about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I was younger both my sisters would be given VHS copies of Disney movies at a rate of about two a year, one for Christmas and one at their birthday. It seems strange today to think of that pace of movie acquisition, never mind the clunky VHS cassettes and how they would warp over time. I didn’t really ever get any of the Disney movies myself but I would inevitably find myself watching them with my sisters who would watch them repeatedly. With just four TV channels back then, who could blame us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was growing up a framed print of a map hung on the wall in the hallway. It was one of my favourite things, littered with strange latin names and with Vs where Us should have been. The outlines of the continents and countries were all familiar and yet slightly distorted, becoming more recognisable around the shores of western Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don’t know the provenance of that map print but at some point it got taken to the charity shop and replaced by Van Gogh’s sunflowers. I guess that means that I shall never be able to work out exactly what map it was and when it was from.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have had the sort of month that is not conducive to listening to much new music. Therefore this month’s post is only going to consider two new albums and two albums that I have bought behind time. Because of various bits of stress and poor mood, I have ended up going back and taking refuge in some old favourites and not listening to new stuff. At other points I have also gone back to the Fleet Foxes’ album that I wrote about last month, which has grown on me even more since. Sometimes I think that I should writing about these albums on a two month delay. Meanwhile, I even have new music that I haven’t listened to &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;, namely &lt;strong&gt;Bon Iver&lt;/strong&gt;’s self-titled album. It has received so many good reviews that I have been too intimidated to listen to it. I will try to write about it next month.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understated Classics #10: Tubular Bells II by Mike Oldfield</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/understated-classics-10/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was the artwork that got me interested in Tubular Bells II. Rendering Trevor Key&amp;rsquo;s wonderful icon of the twisted tubular bell in yellow and blue made it all the more mysterious. Seeing it one day in Woolworth&amp;rsquo;s in Leigh Park back in 1992 aroused my curiosity. The huge display must have been part of the massive publicity drive for the album. Despite dwindling sales for his albums at that time, a sequel to Tubular Bells represented a huge potential for sales. This is why Oldfield had been lured from his previous home at Virgin records over to Warner Music. At that point Oldfield had not made a good album since his soundtrack to the movie &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087553/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Killing Fields&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 1985, the end of a hot streak (perhaps 1980&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;QE2&lt;/em&gt; aside) that had lasted since the original &lt;em&gt;Tubular Bells&lt;/em&gt; back in 1973.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What’s your favourite number?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was ambivalent on this issue until a few months ago until I came across the following quirky result: if you start with the prime number 41 and then add 2 you get 43, which is also prime and then if you add 4 to 43, you get 47: also prime. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=evaluate+x%5E2%E2%88%92x%2B41+for+x+from+0..40&#34;&gt;And this continues to produce prime numbers if you add successive multiples of two to your running total&lt;/a&gt;, UNTIL… you get to the 41st number in this sequence, which is 41 squared.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

CCTV, the GPS on your phone or the signals sent by your more primitive model to the masts to keep in touch with the network. Your cash withdrawals, your purchases in Tesco and your journeys on public transport all add to the picture of where you are. If you drive, your sat nav will hold clues to where you have been and, if you disappear, where you might have gone to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Four albums this month:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Kate Bush &lt;em&gt;Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Africa Hitech &lt;em&gt;93 Million Miles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fleet Foxes &lt;em&gt;Helplessness Blues&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;TV On The Radio &lt;em&gt;Nine Types of Light&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a pleasing red hue to all the covers this month. I had time to write four full reviews of the major albums I listened to. Like last month I have included a video at the foot of each review. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;kate-bush-directors-cut&#34;&gt;Kate Bush &lt;em&gt;Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt; is not a new album from Kate Bush but a collection of re-visits to old songs, four from &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sensual_World&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sensual World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (1989) and seven from [&lt;em&gt;The Red Shoes&lt;/em&gt;](&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Shoes_(album)&#34;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Shoes_(album)&lt;/a&gt; (1993). It is certainly an interesting idea to re-examine old songs with hindsight, something usually only done with live albums or dodgy remixes. It is rare to have an artist to even admit flaws in their earlier material, let alone for them to go back and attempt to fix them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understated Classics #9: Tiger Bay by Saint Etienne</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tiger Bay&lt;/em&gt; is Saint Etienne&amp;rsquo;s third album and I think it is among their best. It was released in June 1994 on Heavenly records. I first owned a copy in 1998 when I picked it up while living in halls as an undergraduate. The reason for including this album in the understated classics series is the same as for &lt;a href=&#34;uc8&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Second Light&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Dreadzone: it marries traditional forms to newer electronic music&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Second Light&lt;/em&gt; melds classical music and sea shanties to house and dub reggae to evoke the rolling hills and mystic caves of England. &lt;em&gt;Tiger Bay&lt;/em&gt; grafts folk structures on to Balearic pop songs and electronic experiments in order to visit motorway verges, windswept seashores, and Mediterranean holidays. There is even a ghost story (&lt;em&gt;Boy Scouts of America&lt;/em&gt;) for good measure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The other day while writing some rather self-pitying notes in my blog book (yes, I handwrite all this rubbish before I go to bed at night!) I came up with some useless superheroes, or rather the only superheroes that a washed-up guy in his early thirties could hope to be. Because I haven’t got any ideas for “five things on the fifth” this month, I decided to flesh out a few of these. Last month I began the five on the fifth meme with &lt;a href=&#34;five-things-to-try-when-you-cant-sleep&#34;&gt;five things to try if you can’t sleep&lt;/a&gt; and so this is a rather forced attempt to keep it going. I promise that I will try and think of more interesting posts on these lines for months.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;album-of-the-month-mirrorwriting-by-jamie-woon&#34;&gt;Album of the month: &lt;em&gt;Mirrorwriting&lt;/em&gt; by Jamie Woon&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jamie Woon was brought to my attention late last year by Pitchfork who wrote an article about the video for lead single &lt;em&gt;Night Air&lt;/em&gt;. I’ve put that video down below because I think that it is very good, a simple well executed and the tune itself is brilliant, probably my favourite individual track of 2010. It’s a downtempo tune full of dark spaces and empty beats, full of nocturnal promise and mystery. Hungry for more, I also bought the &lt;em&gt;Wayfaring Stranger&lt;/em&gt; EP and pre-ordered &lt;em&gt;Mirrorwriting&lt;/em&gt; as soon as it was possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I saw &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090563/&#34;&gt;Betty Blue&lt;/a&gt; (original French title &lt;em&gt;37,2 Le Matin&lt;/em&gt;) for the first time in 1996 shortly after having read the book and it remains one of my favourite films to this day. Although there are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.co.uk/images?hl=en&amp;amp;source=hp&amp;amp;biw=1427&amp;amp;bih=1022&amp;amp;q=b%C3%A9atrice+dalle+betty+blue&amp;amp;gbv=2&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;aqi=&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;uss=1&#34;&gt;many obvious reasons why&lt;/a&gt; a sixteen year old boy might like it, I think it does stand up to scrutiny beyond the sex and nudity. This post is a brief explanation of some of the obvious and not-so-obvious reasons why this is a film to be loved and cherished. (It was quite interesting to write this defence of a sexy film!)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Facebook is wonderful for keeping in touch but I’ve noticed that quite a few of my friends tend to use it to tell the world that they can’t sleep. Here’s some advice for you if you find yourself unable to sleep one night. I’ve often had to try these out myself! Note that these are just things that work for me and your mileage may vary, particularly if you are fortunate enough to have a partner next to you! You may need to appease them if you wriggle around too much.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before &lt;a href=&#34;more-books&#34;&gt;I am re-reading the novels of Iain Banks&lt;/a&gt; and this weekend I managed to finish &lt;em&gt;Consider Phlebas&lt;/em&gt;. A little post about it will be coming up soon. One of my favourite things about the Culture novels is how the ships are named and having found &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ships_(The_Culture)&#34;&gt;a list on Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, I thought I would share ten of my favourites with you!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll Clean That Up Before You Leave&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ravished By The Sheer Implausibility Of That Last Statement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;All Through With This Niceness And Negotiation Stuff&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prosthetic Conscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Of Course I Still Love You&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Size Isn’t Everything&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hand Me The Gun And Ask Me Again&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dramatic Exit, Or, Thank you And Goodnight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;We Haven’t Met But You’re A Great Fan Of Mine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anticipation Of A New Lover’s Arrival, The&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Great names all I am sure you would agree. Not all of them appear as fully developed characters. In fact (and I will mention this again later) the ships don’t get nearly enough time as characters in the novels apart from &lt;em&gt;Excession&lt;/em&gt;, which is almost entirely devoted to them. In that novel, one ship is central to the story and is probably my favourite, an eccentric GCU (General Contact Unit) called &lt;em&gt;Grey Area&lt;/em&gt; that has been shunned by the other machines for “non-consensual mind reading”. It turns out the ship is somewhat morbid and likes to confront the perpetrators of genocides with their crimes. It is known by the other ships as “the meatf***er” and is totally badass.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;never-mind-the-ballards&#34;&gt;Never mind the Ballards&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been writing about books by &lt;a href=&#34;j-g-ballard&#34;&gt;J.G. Ballard&lt;/a&gt; pretty much to the exclusion of all others. Gradually the posts have tricked out about four novels and ground to a halt. I’ve got a fair way through two other books but I am getting very tired of reading his novels all the time, much as I love them. The mistake I made was that I hadn’t read enough of them in the first place. The project for the site was get the books, read them and then write something. In terms of writing regular posts, this was a bad idea!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understated Classics #8: Second Light by Dreadzone</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&#34;understated-classics&#34;&gt;understated classics&lt;/a&gt; series, I try to alternate between pop/rock and electronic albums. Keeping with this trend number eight is the wonderful dub-infused album &lt;em&gt;Second Light&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dreadzone.com&#34;&gt;Dreadzone&lt;/a&gt;. Released in 1996 it was well-received critically and four of its tracks featured on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/&#34;&gt;John Peel&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s best-of-year list that year. &lt;em&gt;Little Britain&lt;/em&gt; received a lot of radio play, a popular choice for that flag-waving period of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mojo4music.com/13834/the-story-of-britpop-in-60-albums/&#34;&gt;britpop&lt;/a&gt; and assorted other demons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The strengths of &lt;em&gt;Second Light&lt;/em&gt; as an album is the anglicana&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of its first half and the subversion of it in the second half. I often talk of how albums are front-loaded with the best tracks to get you immersed in them. This is probably a hangover from vinyl where you could repeatedly play one side, making it necessary to make cohesive &amp;lsquo;sides&amp;rsquo; of music.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;February, the shortest month, harbinger of such delights as Groundhog Day and Valentine’s Day. Could it possibly produce any good albums? Well the candidates are the eponymous début album by &lt;strong&gt;James Blake&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Zonoscope&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Cut/Copy&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Let England Shake&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;PJ Harvey&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Smart Flesh&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;The Low Anthem&lt;/strong&gt;. Furthermore, there was an unexpected bonus when &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.radiohead.com/deadairspace/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radiohead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; announced that their new album would be out and available to listen to this month too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hurrah for more exoplanets &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2011/feb/02/new-planets-solar-system&#34;&gt;making the news&lt;/a&gt; this week. This time it is a star with a whole bunch of small planets very close to the star, usually they tend to be single gas giants larger even than &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter&#34;&gt;Jupiter&lt;/a&gt; as this &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_exoplanetary_host_stars&#34;&gt;list of stars with exoplanets&lt;/a&gt; from Wikipedia shows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But these stars are all so far away! The closest star with an exoplanet found in orbit around it so far is 10 light years away (Epsilon Eridani) and this week’s system was found over 2000 light years away. To put this in perspective, Voyager 2 is &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/#!/Voyager2/status/32589239199731713&#34;&gt;currently 11 hours 13 minutes and 52 seconds of light travel from Earth&lt;/a&gt; just over 33 years after launch. It hasn’t really left our solar system yet - it is twice as far from the sun as Pluto but not as far as planet X - and according to current calculations it will next encounter a star (Sirius) in 290,000 years time, by which time it will be 8.6 light years from Earth and its instruments will be long dead.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Programming an UNO game, part 2</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It turns out that programming the UNO game is not that complicated once you start designing the thing. This post will get the rules and game elements clear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-deck&#34;&gt;The deck&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An UNO deck consists of four sets of coloured cards (red, yellow, green and blue) together with eight wild cards. The non-wild cards are marked with either numbers or special symbols. The numbers range from zero to nine with two of each number except for the zero, which is unique. For each colour there are also two each of three kinds of special card: SKIP, SWAP and DRAW. The eight wild cards are divided into four each of two types: WILD and WILDFOUR. The wild cards are usually black in UNO decks so we may refer to them as black cards on occasion. There are one hundred and eight cards in total.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>J. G. Ballard, Crash</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;form-and-function-deformation-and-dysfunction&#34;&gt;Form and function, deformation and dysfunction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think we should get one thing out of the way first. For me, there is nothing erotic about a car or a motorway. The place in popular culture of the car in particular as sexual icon has always bemused me. In fact, I’m really rather ambivalent about cars. This matters when discussing &lt;em&gt;Crash&lt;/em&gt;, the 1973 novel by JG Ballard that resumes this strand of posts about his novels. (You can read about &lt;em&gt;The Drowned World&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/the-drowned-world/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Drought&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/the-drought/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Crystal World&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/the-crystal-world/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Album Digest, January 2011</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s to 2011 and the start of a monthly album digest. I want it to be a brief trot through some of the albums I have listened to each month. Sometimes January can bring a few quiet releases by big name bands. This happens if the previous album did not do as well as the record company hoped or if it is the kind of artist who would get lost under the hype of all the Christmas releases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve found twitter to be a bit boring lately but today a perfect storm brew up and once again the Daily Mail and one of its odious columnists was at its centre. Melanie Phillips’ opinion piece was a perfectly constructed piece of trolling that implied that since the repeal of section 28, schools have been flooded with an influx of gay propaganda in subjects like maths, history and geography. Well I’m all for it, Alan Turing &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a genius brutally mistreated by his country despite turning the second world war in favour of the allies - that story is maths and history is combined. Meanwhile, if you can spice up geography a bit go for it. I am not sure what you would do, discuss routes for pride marches? After all, the subject is hideously out of date now that we all have google maps on our phones.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understated Classics #7: 100 Broken Windows by Idlewild</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/understated-classics-7/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Idewild are a solid band who have released four or five albums that I could consider for this series. I&amp;rsquo;m even in the sleeve credits of one: &lt;em&gt;Post-Electric Blues&lt;/em&gt;, if you&amp;rsquo;re asking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the end I went for &lt;em&gt;100 Broken Windows&lt;/em&gt; because it means a lot to me. It has more of a place in my life than the others. Usually I find that this happens if I can remember where I bought an album. In this case I bought a copy of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22533522&#34;&gt;cassette&lt;/a&gt; in Bath HMV at Easter 2000. I can remember the first time that I listened to it too, it was as I marched home to Oldfield Park down Bathwick hill from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bath.ac.uk&#34;&gt;university&lt;/a&gt; that same afternoon. It took exactly the two sides of the tape to get from one door to the other.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
