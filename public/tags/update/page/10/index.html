    <p>Jodorowsky&rsquo;s Dune is a documentary about outlandish Chilean director Alejandro Jodorosky&rsquo;s attempt at a film adaptation of Frank Herbert&rsquo;s Dune in the 1970s. As a big fan of the novel and of science fiction in general, I was very interested in this film. It does not disappoint. It gives a great insight into the mind of a little known (if slightly batty) director and shows even an artistic failure can lead to shock waves that can be felt in later work by others.</p>

    <p>Last night an impromptu firework display occurred. I watched it from my bathroom window. Very pretty and somewhat extravagant, given that there’s no reason for one on the calendar. I could have filmed it on meerkat but it would have diminished the spectacle. However, it did at least motivate me to write this piece that I have put off for a while (since about November I guess?). One where I find out (i.</p>

    <p>There is so much good writing out there. All you have to do is fire up the guardian website, or download the medium app to your smartphone, or visit my friend Barrie&rsquo;s site, or Lee&rsquo;s, and so on and so on.
When it comes to my little whisper into this great choir, it&rsquo;s easy to feel a bit intimidated. How do I add my voice? How do I feel distinct? How do I do it as well as all these other wonderful writers?</p>

    <h1><a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/glow-by-ned-beauman/" title="Ned Beauman, Glow">Ned Beauman, Glow</a></h1>
    <p>Glow is about a guy called Raf, a Londoner whose life is going nowhere in particular; a state of affairs not helped by “Non-24 Hour Sleep/Wake Syndrome”. One night while experimenting with a new ecstacy-like drug that’s apparently derived from a social anxiety medication for dogs, Raf meets a beautiful girl and then loses her to the crowd in a blink-and-you-miss-it moment. From there a conspiracy evolves involving the titular dog-medication-derived drug, Burmese dissidents, corporate espionage, pirate radio stations, and urban foxes.</p>

    <p>Ministry of Sound boss Lohan Presencer does the cry baby act in today&rsquo;s Guardian, complaining that Spotify&rsquo;s freemium model doesn&rsquo;t allow him to bathe in a Scrooge McDuck style swimming pool of golden coins any more. The cat is out of the bag for streaming music now, and no matter how much music companies cry foul they can&rsquo;t stop Spotify and their ilk, and there wouldn&rsquo;t be pots of gold waiting for them even if they could.</p>

    <p>Aphex Twin &ldquo;Computer Controlled Acoustic Instruments Pt2 EP&rdquo; Aphex Twin follows SYRO (reviewed in Album Digest September 2014 here) with this 27 minute EP of music that, if we take the title literally, features computers playing acoustic musical instruments. It&rsquo;s a very different sound to SYRO and sounds acoustic for the most part. It&rsquo;s an important experiment about the role of the musician, one that is already blurred in the creation of electronic music.</p>

    <p>I listened to Let It Come Down by Spiritualized for the first time during a difficult time in my life. I think this will always affect my feelings towards it. For me it&rsquo;s a great big comfort blanket of a record. Coming after one of the all-time best break-up albums (in an artistic sense) in &ldquo;Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space&rdquo; perhaps it&rsquo;s not that much of a surprise.</p>

    <p>I’m pretty close to a round number. To date I have written 298,500 words for this blog, not counting posts that I have discarded or deleted. This will be the 505th post currently on the blog, which makes for an average of just under 600 words per post. Some posts are just a picture or a video or a gallery though, so that distorts the average a bit.
I don’t think I can write the 1500 words I need to hit 300,000 in this post.</p>

    <p>You can&rsquo;t beat a good cheese grater. Cheese just tastes better in a sandwich once it has been grated. It&rsquo;s been proven by ACTUAL SCIENCE that this is the case: something about the increased surface area making it taste more zingy (NB. QI is not actually a peer-reviewed scientific journal). Of course the cheese we are grating here is a nice mature cheddar, you can&rsquo;t grate Camembert or Stilton (well technically you can, but why would you?</p>

    <p>I set myself the task of writing about a fictional character for this blog post, so this post is about Jackson X. His surname isn’t really X, it’s just one of the details about him that I haven’t fleshed out yet. This is because Jackson X is the one of the protagonists of the novel I’m (not) writing.
The name of the novel is “The Summer of the Giant Space Whale”.</p>

    <p>We hear a lot about our rights but these are given to us in return for fulfilling our responsibilities. One of these is engagement in the democratic process, and in particular voting. You should register to vote, that’s a no brainer. You should take an interest in what politics means for you locally, nationally, and internationally. On the day you to get to the polling station and cast your vote. Then you need to hold you representative accountable afterwards, even if he or she isn’t the person you voted for.</p>

    <p>Album Digest January 2015 rounds up a few albums from the tail end of 2014 that I didn&rsquo;t get much time to write about. The only one of these six to be released this month is the excellent &ldquo;No Cities To Love&rdquo; by Sleater-Kinney.
Sleater-Kinney &ldquo;No Cities To Love&rdquo; I had heard of Sleater-Kinney before their boxed set “Start Together” was released in 2014. I was quite impressed that they curated their own Spotify playlist with the contents of the box.</p>

    <p>One of the first lines of &ldquo;The House That Guilt Built&rdquo;, the soft cricket-laden lament that opens The Meadowlands by The Wrens, is &ldquo;I&rsquo;m nowhere near where I thought I&rsquo;d be&rdquo;. The last line of the whole album is &ldquo;this is not what you had planned&rdquo;. These bookending lines set the tone for this shimmering, ramshackle masterpiece - a fatigue and careworn pride in failing to meet impossible standards writ large over its first and last eighty or so seconds.</p>

    <p>Feersum Endjinn is one of Iain Banks&rsquo; few non-Culture sci-fi novels. Like the Culture novels, an existential crisis drives the plot: in this case the action takes place on Earth in the far future and the sun has aged to a point where it will grow and swallow the earth. This is referred to as the Encroachment. The characters are divided between the good guys who seek to find a solution for the greater good and bad guys who use the Encroachment to consolidate their power and influence.</p>

    <p>Just a brief message to wish everyone a happy new year. Getting my flat connected to the internet continues to be a trial so it&rsquo;s still not as easy to post as I would like. However, I have some workarounds now and I hope to write (and post) more often from now on.
Like everyone I make resolutions at this time of year, though as the years pass I realise that the best resolutions are to apopt a new way of being rather than a new way of doing.</p>

    <p>Overlong reflection upon the past is one sure way to make yourself unhappy so I try to avoid it. Nevertheless it becomes unavoidable at this time of year, especially if, like me, you are somewhat prone to reflection.
At this time last year I was, as detailed in the most recent report of my South American adventure, in La Paz, Bolivia. I think I felt as lost then as I do now, though back then I had the novelty of new places and good friends to steer me through.</p>

    <p>I recently started a new job and moved in to a new flat. This means I&rsquo;m too busy to write any long blog posts at the moment. Also I&rsquo;m still not quite at home there, so I tend to spend my evenings tidying up or setting up new things. It&rsquo;s a shame because I have plenty of things to write about (even without observations on moving, starting a new job, etc) but I guess the writing will happen eventually&hellip;</p>

    <p>This is a longer form post about artificial intelligence inspired by reading a little bit of &ldquo;The Pale King&rdquo; by David Foster Wallace and putting a picture of a &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; up on Instagram. This might be the last of these that I&rsquo;m able to write for a while.
On Not Reading &ldquo;The Pale King&rdquo; &ldquo;The Pale King&rdquo; is the third and final novel by American author David Foster Wallace. He was working on it when he committed suicide in 2008.</p>

    <p>Album Digest September 2014 contains four amazing albums, including the long-awaited return from the Aphex Twin, and an album from Cymbals Eat Guitars released about a week after I wondered what had happened to them. Spooky. Rounding out the selection this month are a cool punky-disco album by The Juan Maclean and a truly remarkable offering by Vessel.
Aphex Twin SYRO SYRO is the sixth album by Aphex Twin and his first official Aphex Twin release since Drukqs in 2001.</p>

    <p>This post deals with how to generate random numbers in R. It is good to know how to generate random numbers with a particular language or software package for at least one of the following three reasons:
You want to test something that depends on a particular distribution. You’re running a stochastic process of some kind (Branching process, random walk etc) and you need random numbers for deciding whether an event occurs.</p>
