      <description>&lt;p&gt;The problem with keeping up a blog streak for however many days it is now is that you don&amp;rsquo;t actually get a huge amount of time to think of ideas for posts and actually write them. Ironically, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about this post for a while though.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m having trouble finding something to write about today. Partly the problem of having a productive weekend of doing things rather than ruminating on blog topics. So unfortunately, we get another space-filling post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got lots of books on the go at the moment, including &amp;ldquo;Orbital&amp;rdquo; which won the Booker prize this year and &amp;ldquo;Otherlands&amp;rdquo; which is a really cool book about natural history going back in time through the eras of the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>In Praise of Pilates</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In searching for something to write about today, I wondered whether I had ever written about Pilates on this blog before. I modified &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/fun-with-chatgpt/&#34;&gt;the search of my posts from yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post&lt;/a&gt; to look for the word Pilates&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and it only came up once in &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/ambitions-revisited/&#34;&gt;a post about revisiting my ambitions ten years on&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There I wrote:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I haven’t taken up meditation at all because the inside of my head is way too noisy. What I did do (at Ingrid’s suggestion) is take up Pilates: I swear by it now. It’s not quite the same as meditation but I’ve found the improvements to my core strength to be quite useful for my mental health.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Don&#39;t Break The Chain</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2025 might be a tough year, but I am going to try and blog every day. It means that now and then I might be writing a post like this one, where I am writing for the sake of continuing the streak. If I find myself doing that too often then I will take the hint and stop trying!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This weekend was the 3rd round of the FA Cup, which is when the premier league and championship teams enter the competition. This is the first time for quite a few years where Portsmouth have entered at this stage. Naturally, they&amp;rsquo;re already out! Mind you, in recent years when they&amp;rsquo;ve entered at the first round they haven&amp;rsquo;t made it past those rounds either. That was bad news for one pub in Portsmouth which always made a big show of not taking down their Christmas decorations until Pompey were out of the FA Cup!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
