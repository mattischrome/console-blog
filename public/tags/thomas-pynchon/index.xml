      <description>Tonight I finally caught up with Inherent Vice, Paul Thomas Anderson&amp;rsquo;s adaptation of Thomas Pynchon&amp;rsquo;s novel. It stars Joaquin Phoenix as Larry &amp;lsquo;Doc&amp;rsquo; Sportello who&amp;rsquo;s put on to a case of possible kidnapping by his &amp;ldquo;ex-old lady&amp;rdquo; Shasta, played by Katherine Waterston.&#xA;There&amp;rsquo;s no point attempting to tell much more you of the plot of Inherent Vice: it&amp;rsquo;s rather convoluted and self-digesting. At least this means there&amp;rsquo;s very little chance of stumbling into inadvertent spoilers.</description>

      <description>The existence, or impending existence, of a new novel by Thomas Pynchon was announced today. I have all his previous books (seven written over a period of about fifty years, a pace that I definitely approve of), though he’s a hard author to get close to: I’ve only finished three and started four up till now. The unfinished one is, of course, Gravity’s Rainbow (GR) and somewhat perversely, I have two copies of the thing.</description>
