      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m back in the UK so it’s back to posts about albums each month. This one is a bit different because I didn’t listen to very much new stuff while I was away so not all of the albums are up to date. I had to write about the new album by Liars though because it&amp;rsquo;s awesome and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait to discuss it! Here’s the list of albums:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tegan and Sarah &lt;em&gt;Heartthrob&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fanfarlo &lt;em&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s Go Extinct&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Liars &lt;em&gt;Mess&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;London Grammar &lt;em&gt;If You Wait&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;tegan-and-sarah-_heartthrob_&#34;&gt;Tegan and Sarah &lt;em&gt;Heartthrob&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would argue, as I have throughout my sequence of &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/tags#understated-classics/&#34;&gt;understated classics&lt;/a&gt; posts, that a great album is one that changes you as a person. Sometimes an album changes your mood consistently, sometimes an album makes you think about the experiences in your life differently, and sometimes an album is just so great and comes along at just the right time to knock you for six. I’d say that in 2014 Tegan and Sara’s “Heartthrob” has been that album for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understated Classics #24: Reservoir by Fanfarlo</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have written a lot in these posts about how music gets indelibly tied up with places, events and feelings. For me this album by Fanfarlo is tied up with all three of these. It makes me happy and sad at the same time in memory of great times that are now gone but are fondly remembered. I am aware that this is the youngest album on the list so far and so it might be a bit early to endow classic status upon it, but &amp;ldquo;Reservoir&amp;rdquo; is a fine album and to my ears it stands up really well. Listening to it again in the course of writing this post I found that I remembered every note and musical phrase, and yet somehow I also managed to delight in hearing new features in the production that I&amp;rsquo;d not noticed before.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Five albums for Album Digest March 2012&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fanfarlo &lt;em&gt;Rooms Filled With Light&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Shins &lt;em&gt;Port Of Morrow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Grails &lt;em&gt;Deep Politics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;New Build &lt;em&gt;Yesterday Was Lived And Lost&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Scuba &lt;em&gt;Personality&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A nice collection of albums this month - things usually pick up in March after a slow period after Christmas. One of these is a “catch-up” (the album by Grails) but apart from that one, everything else was released in the last five weeks or so… I should probably have included the album by Racehorses that I bought on my birthday but I will have to leave that for next month as I haven’t listened to it that much. In fact, it is still in my housemate’s car!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
