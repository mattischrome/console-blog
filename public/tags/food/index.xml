      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a massive fan of hot chocolate. Recently a friend recommended M&amp;amp;S hot chocolate flakes. Thanks to a promotion it was about half the price of the Montezuma&amp;rsquo;s hot chocolate discs that we usually buy. The Montezuma&amp;rsquo;s ones are lush (that&amp;rsquo;s official hot chocolate tasting terminology) but in this economy anything that saves a bit of money has got to be good right?&#xA;However, there are other things to consider. For one, what&amp;rsquo;s the cost per drink?</description>

      <description>The A-Z of Cooking by Felicity Cloake This book is for more luxurious and experimental recipes. There are 26 chapters, one for an ingredient beginning with each letter of the alphabet, but you probably guessed that already. Ingrid and I have been (very) slowly working our way through the chapters, making a couple of recipes from each one - weâ€™re currently up to G for Garlic.&#xA;My favourite so far has been the bread dumplings in parmesan broth because it gives us a use for our many many parmesan rinds.</description>

      <title>Beetroot Bolognaise</title>

      <description>We cook this version of bolognaise with beetroot due to Ingrid&amp;rsquo;s tomato allergy. This recipe is an attempt to capture what we do on the fly. The key to it is using the wine, the Worcestershire sauce and the herbs to even out the sweetness of the beetroot. If you can manage that, it&amp;rsquo;s super tasty. The sauce usually ends up being an unusual but pleasing pink/purple colour, as you will see from the pictures.</description>

      <title>On The Humble Cheese Grater</title>

      <description>You can&amp;rsquo;t beat a good cheese grater. Cheese just tastes better in a sandwich once it has been grated. It&amp;rsquo;s been proven by ACTUAL SCIENCE that this is the case: something about the increased surface area making it taste more zingy (NB. QI is not actually a peer-reviewed scientific journal). Of course the cheese we are grating here is a nice mature cheddar, you can&amp;rsquo;t grate Camembert or Stilton (well technically you can, but why would you?</description>
