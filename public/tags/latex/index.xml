      <title>TIL: footnotes in Latex captions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I had an interesting bug in some Latex code I am writing. Putting a footnote into a caption caused the document to fail compilation. The problem was that this document doesn&amp;rsquo;t use a table of figures at the start, so I hadn&amp;rsquo;t thought to include a short summary caption. Apparently the curly brace in the footnote command does not sit well with that, even if you aren&amp;rsquo;t using a list or table of figures in your document. The solution is simple, as long as the footnote isn&amp;rsquo;t crucial to the list of tables!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2005, towards the end of the second year of my PhD I presented a poster at a conference in Dresden, Germany. My eccentric colleagues and I stayed on a huge canal boat moored on the Elbe for no discernible reason other than it seemed like a laugh at the time. In reality I was the second worst snorer of the three of us and it also turned out that our room was right underneath the gang-plank and every morning at six the person who made breakfast would stomp across it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
