      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;among-fields-of-crystal--wind-in-lonely-fences&#34;&gt;Among Fields of Crystal / Wind in Lonely Fences&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have written about a &lt;a href=&#34;uc4&#34;&gt;fair&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;uc6&#34;&gt;number of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;uc13&#34;&gt;ambient&lt;/a&gt; albums in this series (and there are at least two more to come!) but perhaps none are as unobtrusive as this one by Howard Budd and Brian Eno. Itâ€™s a subtle collection of music that sits at the margins of your consciousness: for a long time it was the music that I turned to when I could not sleep but I could just as easily imagine it as (ahem!) romantic background music as I could something to work to. I actually bought it in 2006 to listen to on an overnight flight back from the US.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
