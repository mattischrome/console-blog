      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been about 5 months now since the release of Civilisation VII and it&amp;rsquo;s starting to become a playable game. This is partly due to me getting used to it and partly the effect of quality of life patches and additional features.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Civ Leaders #4: Qin Shi Huang (Mandate of Heaven) of China</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, it&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I wrote &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/civ-leaders-3-amanitore-of-nubia&#34;&gt;my last Civ VI leader post about Amanitore of Nubia&lt;/a&gt; and there&amp;rsquo;s been a whole host of new leaders and personas added to the game since then. Among these the number of Chinese leaders has increased from two to five. Therefore it&amp;rsquo;s probably a good time to start writing about one of them, and where better to start than the OG himself, Qin Shi Huang. The recent leader pass has created a new persona for him but today we shall focus on his original version, which is now referred to in-game as his &amp;ldquo;Mandate of Heaven&amp;rdquo; persona.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Civ Leaders #3: Amanitore of Nubia</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Amanitore of Nubia is available in a base game DLC. She also has her own scenario “The Gifts of the Nile”, which like most scenarios has unique tech and civic trees. You need to assert your dominance over the Nile by building seven temples. The scenario combines faith and military tactics in a satisfying way and you can also play it as Cleopatra for a different perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alexander of Macedon is available in a base game DLC pack alongside Darius of Persia. He also has his own scenario “The Conquests of Alexander”, which is both fun to play and instructive in how to use the formidable benefits of his bonuses and unique units.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s write a guide for all the leaders in Civ 6! It&amp;rsquo;s a nice writing project and I seem to have plenty of time on my hands. For playing Civ VI that is, writing a post for every leader might be another matter&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, let&amp;rsquo;s start with one of my favourites: Hojo Tokimune of Japan.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ingrid and I love playing Civ VI. It&amp;rsquo;s a fine game that improves on previous versions, adding many layers and mechanics that mean you can vary your playing style. In fact, with the recent Gathering Storm expansion there&amp;rsquo;s now an incredible variety of ways to play. The 39 leaders to play with both reflect and provide the game&amp;rsquo;s increased complexity. Each leader has a slightly different mechanic that influences how you play the game, and of course the leaders you are up against also affect your game play. You can pick leaders to go up against that will make your game easier or harder. Some leaders can even be an existential threat if you spawn near to them and, as I&amp;rsquo;ve learned the hard way, it&amp;rsquo;s not always the leaders you expect that cause these problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
