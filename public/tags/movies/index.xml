      <description>&lt;p&gt;I gave up writing reviews of movies because:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I never felt I got the balance right between describing the plot and why I liked the film.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t watch enough movies to be able to draw comparisons that are interesting, just between the small subset of total films that I have watched.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know enough about film making to properly describe why a movie made me feel a particular way and how to discuss the different possibilities available to the director, the actors, and the other artists involved with creating a movie.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But of course, every now and then you see a movie and think &amp;ldquo;wow! I need to tell people about this&amp;rdquo;. And for me that recent film was &amp;ldquo;Decision To Leave&amp;rdquo;, a Korean film that was released last year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
