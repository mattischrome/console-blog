    <p>Oct. 8, 2020</p>
    <p>Recently I&rsquo;ve had cause to dig out some old photos. If I&rsquo;m honest it&rsquo;s made me sad. Sadder than I was expecting. There&rsquo;s a quote from Nan Goldin that once felt like a warning but now just sounds like a sad statement of ongoing affairs:
“I used to think that I could never lose anyone if I photographed them enough. In fact, my pictures show me how much I’ve lost.”</p>

    <p>Jul. 7, 2020</p>
    <p>I decided to create my own deck of creativity cards. I was sick of all the adverts for similar products on Instagram. You know the kind. They&rsquo;re covered in pictures, patterns, and buzzwords. You shuffle the cards and draw them one at a time. As you place each card on the table, the brain’s natural desire to tell stories, create patterns and produce meaning takes over.
I made a deck without too much thought for form or consequence.</p>

    <p>Jun. 11, 2020</p>
    <p>&ldquo;He keeps biting me on the leg&rdquo; says Ingrid one day as I mill around her desk during the new water cooler moment that is a comfort break on a Microsoft Teams call. I pat Martok, one of our cats, and he rubs up against me, pretending that he might nibble at me too.
I experience this regularly. It used to be at half five, then at five, and these days at half past four.</p>

    <p>Jun. 1, 2020</p>
    <p>This post explains some of the modifications I made to a minimal Jekyll theme to get this blog as I wanted it. This blog (currently) uses the excellent Sidey theme by Ronalds Vilciņš. His site looks eerily similar to this one, at least at time of writing.
The theme is pretty minimal in terms of features (and appearance) but it scores well on the Google Page Speed test. The features I added have increased the build time, but have not affected the speed of the site in terms of the page speed test.</p>

    <p>May. 31, 2020</p>
    <p>While sprucing up this blog a bit during lockdown, I fell into reading my old posts about South America. I enjoyed it, mostly for the memories, but also because the current lockdown is warping my sense of time and space. Hours feel like weeks, but then I blink and a month&rsquo;s gone by. I find myself traipsing similar orbits each day around the house, and then perhaps over to the supermarket or the park.</p>

    <p>May. 30, 2020</p>
    <p>Over the course of a week on holiday, I started reading many interesting articles. In lockdown there isn&rsquo;t much to do but read articles, but I still find myself not that good at finishing them. My phone has lots of tabs open and has become a Rolodex of shame. This post is to confess my sins.
I&rsquo;m trying to re-familiarise myself with Python. As with all modern software development, Python now seems atomised and hyper-complicated.</p>

    <p>May. 29, 2020</p>
    <p>Ingrid bought me a raspberry pi for my birthday. I&rsquo;ve set it up to run the Pi-hole software. Pi-hole is a nifty bit of kit that intercepts your web requests and purges any that ask for material on known ad servers. Essentially it&rsquo;s like having an ad blocker on your network rather than just your computer.
I&rsquo;ve written before about why I hate web advertising, and since then it&rsquo;s got even more malign.</p>

    <p>May. 28, 2020</p>
    <p>I read this book on holiday in Belgium last year. Having forgotten to pack a novel I scoured almost every book in the Waterstones at St. Pancras station before settling on this Booker prize winning novel by George Saunders.
Lincoln in the Bardo fictionalises a period in Abraham Lincoln&rsquo;s life immediately after the death of his son Willie. The story alternates between factual accounts of what happened at the time and the observations of ghosts in the graveyard where young Willie is buried.</p>

    <p>May. 27, 2020</p>
    <p>Amanitore of Nubia is available in a base game DLC. She also has her own scenario “The Gifts of the Nile”, which like most scenarios has unique tech and civic trees. You need to assert your dominance over the Nile by building seven temples. The scenario combines faith and military tactics in a satisfying way and you can also play it as Cleopatra for a different perspective.
Civ ability Ta-Seti +50% Production toward Ranged units.</p>

    <p>These are some things I jotted down one day last week, I&rsquo;ll refine them a bit more later on. Think of it as an aide-memoire of things that work for me, your milage may vary.
Don&rsquo;t worry about things that haven&rsquo;t happened. Don&rsquo;t turn whatever has happened and/or is bothering you into a catastrophe, especially if no one else is telling you that it is one. Seek out someone you trust and ask them &ldquo;is this a catastrophe?</p>

    <p>Aug. 26, 2019</p>
    <p>Doves are a band from Manchester who traded dance music for rock yet never left their former genre behind. Starting out as Sub Sub, they scored a worldwide hit in 1993 with &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t No Love (Ain&rsquo;t No Use)&rdquo;: a timeless dance tune that immediately owns whatever room it plays in. However, subsequent releases by Sub Sub did not catch on and people started to think of the band as a one-hit wonder.</p>

    <p>May. 12, 2019</p>
    <p>Alexander of Macedon is available in a base game DLC pack alongside Darius of Persia. He also has his own scenario “The Conquests of Alexander”, which is both fun to play and instructive in how to use the formidable benefits of his bonuses and unique units.
Civ ability Hellenistic Fusion When capturing a city, receive civic boosts for each holy site and theatre square, and tech boosts for each campus and encampment.</p>
