      <description>&lt;p&gt;One album that&amp;rsquo;s lurking in the periphery of my &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;understated classics series&lt;/a&gt; is &amp;ldquo;Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe In You&amp;rdquo; by Big Thief. &amp;ldquo;Bright Future&amp;rdquo; is the latest solo album by Big Thief singer-songwriter Adrianne Lenker and it is just as good. Intimate and intricate, it draws the listener in as Adrianne sings live with a very small band. At times you can hear breaths drawn and the sound feels like a small space that you are cocooned in: this could be sound engineering (spatial audio would have us believe anything is possible) but it&amp;rsquo;s most likely equipment set up intelligently in a cosy studio.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
