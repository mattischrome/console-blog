      <description>&lt;p&gt;These are some things I jotted down one day last week, I&amp;rsquo;ll refine them a bit more later on. Think of it as an aide-memoire of things that work for me, your milage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about things that haven&amp;rsquo;t happened.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t turn whatever has happened and/or is bothering you into a catastrophe, especially if no one else is telling you that it is one. Seek out someone you trust and ask them &amp;ldquo;is this a catastrophe?&amp;rdquo; Not only will they say no about 99.9% of the time, they will often tell you why it isn&amp;rsquo;t a catastrophe.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The people who are important to you will not use your personal characteristics as a laundry list of personal failings in the same way that you do. In fact they won&amp;rsquo;t do it all. What you perceive as your own obvious and innate failings, others will often struggle to even see. Self awareness and hyper-awareness are two different things.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There will be people who don&amp;rsquo;t like you, people who don&amp;rsquo;t think you&amp;rsquo;re good enough, and people who won&amp;rsquo;t give you a chance. They most likely intersect, meaning there are fewer of them than you might think. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to satisfy these people, only those who like you and support you. Most of all, you have to be good enough for you.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Everybody has different needs and wants in life. Even though your needs and wants will often intersect with those of others, there is still no reason to use other people as the measure for what you should be getting out of life.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A person has more depth and dimensions than are measurable. If you focus solely on a single metric when you measure yourself against some standard or goal, you will be wrong in some way or another. A qualified and multi-dimensional validation of your progress will give you a more nuanced and more supportive sense of where you are heading and how to correct yourself.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Always focus on your capability. Regard potential as something to be shaped into capability.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Take time to think about things in many different ways, employing both proven mental models and lateral thinking.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Often problems are easier to tackle once you have been for a walk in the countryside.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <title>Any sugar?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/some-sugar/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not being much of a drinker, I&amp;rsquo;ve never felt the need to do &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/alcohol/Pages/dry-january-helped-me-take-back-control-of-my-drinking.aspx&#34;&gt;dry January&lt;/a&gt;. Also Ingrid and I sat in a restaurant in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mattischrome.com/spain-new-year-201718/&#34;&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; on January 2nd drinking for the third night in row. We hadn&amp;rsquo;t got off to that great a start. Well today marks the completion of a dry month: dry January with a two day lag.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also (mostly) managed to keep to my other goal of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/16/case-against-sugar-sweetness-and-blight-rachel-cooke&#34;&gt;eliminating sugar&lt;/a&gt; from my tea and coffee. This meant I cut out at least three teaspoons of sugar a day for a month. I can&amp;rsquo;t say it was easy. For a while I compensated by hoovering up the post-Christmas chocolates. Then came a period of the blues, though that was probably just &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias&#34;&gt;confirmation bias&lt;/a&gt;. They don&amp;rsquo;t call the third Monday of January &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/blog/truth-about-blue-monday&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;blue Monday&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; for nothing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I often ponder whether the joys of waking up early are greater than those of staying up late. Empirical evidence seems to bear this out: all those people who get to work before you do, super-eager to get everything done. But then all the people walking under your windows late at night, drunk and laughing, they sound like they&amp;rsquo;re having a whale of a time too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I oscillate between the two extremes, though I tend to sleep better if I stay up late. My natural sleep hours are 1am to 8am, though I am usually human if I can get up just after 7. Whenever I try to stick to getting up early, to do masochistic things like running or being organised, I often find it harder to get to sleep or I wake up at 3 rather than 6. I end up second guessing my alarm clock.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On Writing As It Happens</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/writing-as-it-happens/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty close to a round number. To date I have written 298,500 words for this blog, not counting posts that I have discarded or deleted. This will be the 505th post currently on the blog, which makes for an average of just under 600 words per post. Some posts are just a picture or a video or a gallery though, so that distorts the average a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I can write the 1500 words I need to hit 300,000 in this post. It’s quite hard to write on demand and I often feel like my bright ideas are unassailable when I sit down to type them up. I’m conscious that I have to keep turning up to type but I’m not sure that it’s worthwhile to write posts like this simply to keep up a streak. A blog should be like an iceberg: the heft below the water line will make everything above it more beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>October and November 2014</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently started a new job and moved in to a new flat. This means I&amp;rsquo;m too busy to write any long blog posts at the moment. Also I&amp;rsquo;m still not quite at home there, so I tend to spend my evenings tidying up or setting up new things. It&amp;rsquo;s a shame because I have plenty of things to write about (even without observations on moving, starting a new job, etc) but I guess the writing will happen eventually&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a bit behind in my posts about the trip and this post interrupts the sequence of events somewhat, just because I&amp;rsquo;ve not felt that well and that has dominated my thoughts about what to write. Basically for a week or two I&amp;rsquo;ve had varying degrees of bellyache and it&amp;rsquo;s not been fun. Instead of feeling the gratitude and excitement I&amp;rsquo;ve felt since being here, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a lot of time wanting to curl up in the corner and just be&amp;hellip; well&amp;hellip; somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Reset Button</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/the-reset-button/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;previously-on&#34;&gt;Previously on&amp;hellip;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I planned this post as a follow-up to one called &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/the-truth-about-work/&#34;&gt;The Truth About Work&lt;/a&gt; from a couple of months ago, but a few things happened that changed my thinking. It has implications for my future and in particular, it redefines what this break from work and upcoming trip means to me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the punchlines to &amp;ldquo;The Truth About Work&amp;rdquo; was that, sometimes, the only way to move ahead is to quit. I originally put it a little more baldly: I said that you &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; have to quit in order to move on from a sticky situation. Because I knew I was about to quit, I felt I had to write about that decision in unequivocal terms. Obviously I don&amp;rsquo;t think that you should just tap out every single time that things get a little tough. I am not even sure now whether I should have done it at all: hitting the reset button so far in advance of the tour no longer feels like the great idea that it once did. I wasted a lot of the last six weeks and the principal effect of that has been to erode my self-esteem and my bank account.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, when I am feeling a bit down, I like to write down some of my ambitions. As you can see from this list they are mostly pretty humble but they are also a bit cheesy and embarassing, so I have put them after the fold!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Be wholehearted, cheerful, and sincere&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Be creative&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Look at the world and see its many faces, hear its many voices&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Explore new recipes as often as possible when I cook&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Learn to like the taste of tomatoes and cucumbers&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Be more at ease around people&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Listen to people and hear what they say&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Play my part&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Look after someone special&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Become a parent&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Share my values with others, help those who need it&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Break up all the negative things inside me&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Know what other people want, help them get it&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When I wake up each morning I would like to remember my dreams&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Understand art more than I do&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lose my fear of creepy crawlies&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Learn to drive&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Learn to write left handed (why not?)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Visit every country in Europe&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Visit the radio telescopes on Mauna Kea in Hawaii&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Let go of unnecessary things&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ditch social networks and the rest of the internet as much as possible&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Learn to appreciate the noise around me&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Meditate&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Get over my reliance on sugar to improve my mood&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Get rid of things I don’t need&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Grow the garden&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Write people letters&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Learn the differences between species of trees&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Be flexible and adaptable and positive about the future&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Learn how to hang a picture on a wall&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <title>Helen Fisher, Some Lessons In Love</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/some-lessons-in-love/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As indicated by my &lt;a href=&#34;articles/reading-list-mid-april-2012&#34;&gt;reading list&lt;/a&gt; posted a couple of months ago (which has since been added to &lt;a href=&#34;articles/another-reading-list&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), I’ve started to try to read more about the things that I felt that I did not understand so well. Most notably perhaps is this book “on love” by Helen Fisher. Lest there is any innuendo it is not a book about technique nor does it attempt to explain love to those who have never known it, instead it assumes that we have all been there. In fact, the book attempts to explain the neurological mechanisms of love (specifically romantic love) and describes how science has helped reveal these mechanisms to us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Dreams Of A Life: A Short Review</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dreams Of A Life&lt;/em&gt; is a documentary about Joyce Vincent, a woman who was found in her flat three years after her death surrounded by wrapped christmas presents and with the TV still on. £2400 in arrears on her rent, she was discovered by bailiffs who forced the door down. The film attempts to work out happened to Joyce by interviewing people who knew her. In two other strands that unfold in parallel, various events from her life are re-enacted along with the clearing of her flat by forensics officers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Beta Test Of Everything</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/a-beta-test-of-everything/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/a-beta-test-of-everything/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading a few articles about the recent launch of Google+, a few things hit home. Google tends to launch a product that works and not always one that is perfect or finished (like, say, Apple). Sometimes it takes them several iterations to get right. They love the beta tag. In fact, I think it was Google (or possibly Flickr) that made me aware of the concept of beta software.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Along these line I thought about this blog and its one year anniversary. I take a similar approach here to posts on this blog, specifically in pushing out new categories now and then. I have done this in the hope that adding a new subject or thread will lead to me writing more posts. Currently I am averaging ten posts a month, which is not too bad.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Five Things To Try When You Can&#39;t Sleep</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Facebook is wonderful for keeping in touch but I’ve noticed that quite a few of my friends tend to use it to tell the world that they can’t sleep. Here’s some advice for you if you find yourself unable to sleep one night. I’ve often had to try these out myself! Note that these are just things that work for me and your mileage may vary, particularly if you are fortunate enough to have a partner next to you! You may need to appease them if you wriggle around too much.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the run there has been a bit of a hiatus in this blog. I wrote about how running was making me feel better. In fact, I should have said more. I recently stopped taking the antidepressants that I had been taking for eighteen months. This has been my longest period taking such medication but the running made me feel sufficiently good to decide that I could stop taking them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, Saturday. Finally. The big day. Would I a) be able to get to Greenwich in time for the registration? and b) be able to make it all the way around the course without collapsing and crying?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../../assets/images/other/movember01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Picture of Matt at Movember 10K run 2010&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Happily the answer to both questions was a resounding “Yes!” and I really enjoyed it. The weather was really good, especially compared to the two days before hand, and Marc came along to take some brilliant photos.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
