      <description>I gave up writing reviews of movies because:&#xA;I never felt I got the balance right between describing the plot and why I liked the film. I don&amp;rsquo;t watch enough movies to be able to draw comparisons that are interesting, just between the small subset of total films that I have watched. I don&amp;rsquo;t know enough about film making to properly describe why a movie made me feel a particular way and how to discuss the different possibilities available to the director, the actors, and the other artists involved with creating a movie.</description>
