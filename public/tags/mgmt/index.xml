      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know very much about MGMT these days. I haven&amp;rsquo;t read any interviews about their albums. The video to the single &amp;ldquo;Nothing to Declare&amp;rdquo; was brought to my attention by the YouTube channel Justin Hawkins Rides Again. In it he points out how melodically interesting the song is. To be honest I was more than a little bit in love with the video.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After that I added the album to my library and heard a few more singles in the run up to the release of the album, including &amp;ldquo;Bubblegum Dog&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Mother Nature&amp;rdquo;. The album itself is crammed with similarly interesting songs and has a circular structure, beginning with part 2 of the title track. I&amp;rsquo;d love to know what poem is being read or sampled or cut up on &amp;ldquo;Loss of Life, Pt. 2&amp;rdquo;. Other highlights include &amp;ldquo;Phradie&amp;rsquo;s Song&amp;rdquo; and a song called &amp;ldquo;Nothing Changes&amp;rdquo; which goes a bot bonkers in the second half, completely undermining the title of the song!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
