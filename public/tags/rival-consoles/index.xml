      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;mary-epworth-elytral&#34;&gt;Mary Epworth &amp;ldquo;Elytral&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This album came to my attention because its lead single &amp;ldquo;Me Swimming&amp;rdquo; appeared on my Discover Weekly playlist. I&amp;rsquo;d never heard of Mary before but this album was one of those nice discoveries that one sometimes makes when one tries to broaden what one listens to. The aforementioned &amp;ldquo;Me Swimming&amp;rdquo; is probably the best track, a beautiful slice of summery experimental pop layered over a beat that you can imagine as the kicks of a swimmer compared to the swirling lyric that imitates the pull of the strokes through the water. Or the other way round. I was a latecomer to swimming, I&amp;rsquo;m not very good at it. But I do know a good song when I hear one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
