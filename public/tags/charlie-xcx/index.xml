      <description>&lt;p&gt;When making my albums of the year posts at the start of the month, I realised that compared to many other critics lists, there was no sign of &lt;em&gt;Brat&lt;/em&gt; by Charlie XCX. And when it came up again on my album shuffle the other day, I  thought I should re-evaluate the album and whether it should have made my list.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Listening to &lt;em&gt;Brat&lt;/em&gt; again for this post, it was clear that I&amp;rsquo;d missed out on something special. This was partly because I went for a walk with it on my headphones and that always lets me hear the details of the music. I think too many times when this album came on at home, it would be a little bit too doof-doof to be background music. These are songs that do demand (and deserve) a bit of attention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
