    <h1><a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/the-martian-a-short-review/" title="The Martian: A Short Review">The Martian: A Short Review</a></h1>
    <p>In my review of the book I mentioned that a film adaptation of The Martian was on the way. I&rsquo;m not sure why but it got released earlier than any of the dates that I&rsquo;d seen and so on Saturday I found myself watching The Martian on the big screen. Could the film version deliver the same level of entertainment as the novel? Could Mark Watney (Matt Damon) get off Mars alive?</p>

    <p>&ldquo;Satin Island&rdquo; is my pick for the Man Booker prize, announced tomorrow. I&rsquo;ve not managed to read all of it yet. Also, I&rsquo;ve only glanced at the others on the shortlist.
My prediction record on selecting the winner of the Booker from the shortlist is pretty good, though all I&rsquo;m ever doing is guess the outcome of a 1 in 6 chance, like the roll of a die. Often it&rsquo;s a book that I really hope will win rather than one I know will (except &ldquo;Wolf Hall&rdquo; and its sequel).</p>

    <p>Time and Time Again is a ridiculously stupid novel by Ben Elton. A shadowy sect (established by Isaac Newton no less!) recruits a soldier to go back in time and prevent Franz Ferdinand&rsquo;s assassination in Sarajevo in August 1914. I wonder if it all goes to plan and everyone lives happily ever after with no weird timey-wimey after-effects?
Needless to say this novel makes me wish that time travel were a real thing so that I could travel back in time and slap myself in the face while in the queue to buy this tripe.</p>

    <p>La Paz to Potosi We left La Paz, this time ascending the rim of steep hills around the city in a slightly less clunky &ldquo;Death Bus&rdquo;. Perhaps it was because we were travelling uphill or because it was daylight, but it didn&rsquo;t seem so bad.
We set off to Potosi through strange towns with weird monuments (see the pictures) and Oruro where great festivals happen around Ash Wednesday each year that are famous throughout the continent.</p>

    <p>Y-12 is the United States&rsquo; most secure weapons-grade Uranium storage facility. It is known as the &ldquo;Fort Knox of Uranium&rdquo;. In 2012 it was infiltrated by three elderly peace protesters, sparking a major scandal about the safety of US nuclear sites. &ldquo;Gods of Metal&rdquo; by Eric Schlosser tells the story of that break-in alongside a history of both the anti-nuclear movement (in particular the Plowshares movement) and nuclear security in the United States.</p>

    <p>It&rsquo;s difficult to write honestly about your feelings. It&rsquo;s difficult to write about your feelings consistently, for a living on a regular basis. It&rsquo;s difficult to write about your feelings when the world constantly intrudes with inanity, insanity and hatred. It&rsquo;s difficult to write under those conditions without seeming frayed, without coming loose at the edges.
&ldquo;Get To Heaven&rdquo;, the third album by Everything Everything, was forged under these stresses and pressures.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/inherent-vice-a-short-review/" title="Inherent Vice: A Short Review">Inherent Vice: A Short Review</a></h1>
    <p>Tonight I finally caught up with Inherent Vice, Paul Thomas Anderson&rsquo;s adaptation of Thomas Pynchon&rsquo;s novel. It stars Joaquin Phoenix as Larry &lsquo;Doc&rsquo; Sportello who&rsquo;s put on to a case of possible kidnapping by his &ldquo;ex-old lady&rdquo; Shasta, played by Katherine Waterston.
There&rsquo;s no point attempting to tell much more you of the plot of Inherent Vice: it&rsquo;s rather convoluted and self-digesting. At least this means there&rsquo;s very little chance of stumbling into inadvertent spoilers.</p>

    <p>This little masterpiece was released in 1991. I got my copy on cassette for Christmas that year, but by May in 1992 they&rsquo;d already &ldquo;retired&rdquo; and split up.
The KLF were a band in the right place at the right time with the right idea. Taking advantage of synthesizers and the idea of fusing rock and pop music with the emerging sound of house music, they laid the ground for many of the most successful electronic acts that followed them.</p>

    <p>A few months ago I wrote about an idea for a novel that I&rsquo;d abandoned. I mentioned in that post that I&rsquo;d abandoned it because there was another idea that I wanted to pursue. The working title for it is &ldquo;Untitled 2&rdquo;. (It isn&rsquo;t really, I have an actual working title that would give things away or would at least make me feel like the idea was out in the world.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/first-light-last-light/" title="First Light, Last Light">First Light, Last Light</a></h1>
    <p>I often ponder whether the joys of waking up early are greater than those of staying up late. Empirical evidence seems to bear this out: all those people who get to work before you do, super-eager to get everything done. But then all the people walking under your windows late at night, drunk and laughing, they sound like they&rsquo;re having a whale of a time too.
I oscillate between the two extremes, though I tend to sleep better if I stay up late.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/minions-a-short-review/" title="Minions: A Short Review">Minions: A Short Review</a></h1>
    <p>The Minions got their own movie, just as I predicted in my review of Despicable Me 2. I went to see it this week and I enjoyed it a lot. Here&rsquo;s a short review. Don&rsquo;t worry, there are no spoilers here that aren&rsquo;t in the trailer.
It&rsquo;s very funny. Right from the opening credits you get the minions and their anarchic fun-loving slapstick humour. There&rsquo;s always been something delightful about they way in which they innocently bumble around.</p>

    <p>My previous post about Apple Music was more a response to how it was presented at the WWDC Keynote rather than to the idea of Apple Music itself. I should have known better than to use that clickbait title. I knew I wasn&rsquo;t writing about the product, more the flatness of its introduction (despite the names on show).
After a few days of living with it I thought I&rsquo;d write about it and Spotify, so that it&rsquo;s not just my snarky comments about the keynote that are on record here.</p>

    <p>To reboot this series, Album Digest June 2015 features five fantastic albums from Hot Chip, Jamie xx, Blanck Mass, Holly Herndon, and The Orb. I could pick loads more as I&rsquo;ve listened to a lot of albums since February but I decided to focus on the more electronic material. This means that I have no excuses for not continuing next month with a rockier theme.
Hot Chip &ldquo;Why Make Sense?&rdquo; Hot Chip seem to be settling in to a pattern with their album releases, alternating between messy experimental affairs and then a state of the art correction.</p>

    <p>A brief rant about Facebook: I hate the fact that the news feed defaults to “Top Stories” even though I change it back to “Most Recent” every time I log in. It’s a horrible pattern of user abuse that needs to stop. Time is time and that is that.
So why does Facebook feel the need to jiggle things about into a random order? Well most of you have that mobile phone app of theirs that sucks your battery and your data allowance like crazy (mainly by auto-playing videos like a dick).</p>

    <p>I found &ldquo;Learn X in Y minutes&rdquo; (www.learnxinyminutes.com) while researching the programming languages needed for a new project. The site aims to help people who know at least one programming language to learn others by proving a quick run through of the main language features. It&rsquo;s not quite enough to get you up and running. After all, having sample code doesn&rsquo;t get you the compiler. However, it&rsquo;s a nice start that shows you how similar (and different) language X is compared to the one(s) you already know.</p>

    <h1><a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/jims-conservatory/" title="Jim&#39;s Conservatory">Jim&#39;s Conservatory</a></h1>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s assume that Jim has just had a sudden unexpected expenditure: a neighbour released a bull into his back garden and it destroyed his conservatory. Let&rsquo;s assume that the conservatory is essential to Jim&rsquo;s wellbeing, so it has to be fixed immediately. As a result Jim&rsquo;s debts, which were previously small and well-managed, have now increased somewhat.
Obviously Jim can&rsquo;t keep that debt hanging over him forever. What does he do?</p>

    <p>There&rsquo;s a reason I cannot and will not vote Conservative, and like most people&rsquo;s apparent motive for voting tory it is also a selfish one. As someone employed in the public sector, working to ensure the greater good, I&rsquo;m a member of an increasingly endangered species.
Ah Matthew, I hear you say, you&rsquo;re trotting out the old &ldquo;the turkeys have voted for Christmas&rdquo; line. Well no, like I said, this is purely selfish.</p>

    <p>The thirtieth understated classic is by a band named after a fish. There isn&rsquo;t a great deal for me to say about &ldquo;Our Aim Is To Satisfy&rdquo;1 apart from the usual insistence that it is quite good. There&rsquo;s no overarching theme to write about, and no deep personal story attached. It was bound to happen eventually.
&ldquo;Our Aim Is To Satisfy&rdquo; is one of those albums spawned in the late nineties and early naughties at the height of the Electronica boom: dance music that you didn&rsquo;t necessarily have to dance to.</p>

    <p>Or, From There to Here With the Simpsons Old episodes of The Simpsons are great. The other night “Bart After Dark” was on and I really enjoyed seeing it again. It’s from season eight, the one where Bart ends up working in the Maison Derriére. I thought it was older; mind you, this makes it nineteen years old. When I thought about the episode later on that evening, I realised how the story anarchically set out in multiple directions before settling into its main storyline.</p>

    <p>I received a copy of The Martian by Andy Weir for Christmas. This week during some annual leave I managed to finish it. It&rsquo;s one of those novels that just flies by once it gets going. I&rsquo;ve stayed up incredibly late to read it as it is full of those &ldquo;just one more page&rdquo; moments. It’s a readable and enjoyable story of an astronaut trapped on Mars.
Mark Watney is believed to be dead following an accident during an emergency evacuation in a dust storm.</p>
