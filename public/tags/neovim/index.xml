      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to settle on a text editor, IDE, and terminal for a long time now. Partly I&amp;rsquo;m limited by what I can use at work because I owe to myself and my colleagues to be able to reproduce all my skills in a work setting. However, part of me has also wandered off a bit after reading about the idea of a &amp;ldquo;personal Development Environment&amp;rdquo; (or PDE I guess, though in a former life that &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation&#34;&gt;meant something very different&lt;/a&gt;), which is essentially an application where you can do anything and have it configured exactly how you like. Here&amp;rsquo;s an update on my progress on that front:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the absurd barriers to writing regularly is that my new post script is written to open the new markdown file in Neovim and until this week I had no idea how to type a hashtag (which markdown uses for headers) in this editor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Neovim, and its venerable predecessors vi and vim, is notorious for being a bit tricksy to work with. This is because it is a modal editor: you use keys to switch the editor between modes. The same key presses mean different things in different modes, which can be frustrating when you first start out and have no clue what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
