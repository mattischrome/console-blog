      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ingrid and I joined our usual quiz team tonight for the residents&amp;rsquo; association pub quiz. As usual we came third. It&amp;rsquo;s a fairly settled group of attendees and we know our level. We&amp;rsquo;re also quite used to the quiz master and his questions, though I do wish he&amp;rsquo;d acknowledge that pop music continued to be a thing long after the sixties!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s always a pot luck round. On one round we get to play a joker which doubles your points. I normally joke that we should play our joker on pot luck. The idea of countering the randomness of the round by getting double points appeals to me. I think we got a full house on pot luck this month, but we had not played our joker! (EDIT: I&amp;rsquo;m informed by Ingrid that we actually got 20/20 on a food and drink round called &amp;lsquo;Five a day&amp;rsquo;.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
