      <description>&lt;p&gt;For new year Ingrid and I met up with Ingrid&amp;rsquo;s friend Ros at Barcelona airport. We went from there to Cadaqués on the Costa Brava. A winding drive over steep hills leads you down to a cute bay with the typical white houses and terracotta roofs. All the window frames were painted just the right shade of blue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/iceland-part-two&#34;&gt;We left Gulfoss&lt;/a&gt; and drove through the countryside to Fluðir where our next hotel stay would be. The hotel had cute little cabins arranged around a central square and the room itself was comfy and warm. Our dinner was nice enough, although we had a bit of a Fawlty Towers moment with Ingrid’s chicken salad. First it went back because they didn’t leave the BBQ sauce off. Then it came back &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; tomatoes. And then back again with more BBQ sauce. Fourth time lucky.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/iceland-part-one&#34;&gt;After a day on foot in Reykjavík&lt;/a&gt;, and with some trepidation, we returned to the car for our drive through Iceland&amp;rsquo;s countryside. We started by heading out on route 1, which is like Iceland&amp;rsquo;s M25 except that it encircles an entire country &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; about thirty times fewer people. We went to house of Nobel Prize winner Halldór Laxness, only to be turned away because it was being renovated and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t open for another month. Undeterred, we pressed on toward &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Eingvellir&#34;&gt;Þingvellir&lt;/a&gt;, stopping off on the way to take pictures at a viewpoint. It was just crazy, a flat expanse of undisturbed snow. Just as with the drive from the airport, the territory should have been relentlessly bleak but instead we got a winter wonderland.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Reykjavík a few days &lt;a href=&#34;https://weather.com/news/news/reykjavik-iceland-record-snowfall-february&#34;&gt;after a monumental snowstorm&lt;/a&gt;. As such the city was still under at least six inches of snow. We collected the hire car from the airport and drove out of Keflavik. The scenery normally looks like a moonscape, but for us it was a frosty white wonderland.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A little trip to Italy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We bought a cheap package holiday in the British Airways Black Friday sale. The weekend spanned Ingrid&amp;rsquo;s birthday, so it was ideal. £99 each for flights and a hotel, and we bagged a hire car quite cheaply too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just before Easter Ingrid and I went to Lausanne in Switzerland for a few days. It was a much-needed break and my first trip out of the UK since I got back from South America.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
