      <description>Yesterday I went to see the Saloua Raouda Choucair show at the Tate Modern. As it was quite small, I went to see the Lichtenstein show again as well.&#xA;Choucair is an underrated Lebanese artist and many of the paintings and sculptures shown were created in the fifties and sixties. Her sculptures in particular are amazing.&#xA;The first room is lined with paintings that were nearly all gouache on paper, about 40cm by 30cm.</description>
