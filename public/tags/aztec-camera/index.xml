      <description>The next instalment in my understated classics series is &amp;quot;Stray&amp;quot; by Aztec Camera. Released in 1990, it features two hit singles and the cover is my favourite colour: green.&#xA;My angle for writing about “Stray” was that it was an album that I &amp;quot;caught&amp;quot; from my parents. I soon realised that I wrote about some of those already, for example “The Circle and the Square&amp;quot; by Red Box. Besides, I’m not sure that my parents liked this album that much.</description>
