      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over my holiday I read &amp;ldquo;Even The Dogs&amp;rdquo; by Jon McGregor. I&amp;rsquo;ve not quite finished it yet but that will at least prevent me from giving away spoilers. I am not sure I would want to give any spoilers anyway because it is unrelentingly grim so far. Perhaps there is a happy  ending but both you and I will have to read it to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was introduced to Jon McGregor by the book group I was part of during my PhD. I think &amp;ldquo;If Nobody Speaks Of Remarkable Things&amp;rdquo; was the first book I read for the group. At that time of my life, about eight or so years after finishing my English Literature A-level, I had not had to read a book that I had not chosen for myself for quite a long time. I found it to be a complete shock. I can still remember reading about half that book straight out of the amazon packaging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
