      <description>Not being much of a drinker, I&amp;rsquo;ve never felt the need to do dry January. Also Ingrid and I sat in a restaurant in Barcelona on January 2nd drinking for the third night in row. We hadn&amp;rsquo;t got off to that great a start. Well today marks the completion of a dry month: dry January with a two day lag.&#xA;I also (mostly) managed to keep to my other goal of eliminating sugar from my tea and coffee.</description>
