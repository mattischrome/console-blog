      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not being much of a drinker, I&amp;rsquo;ve never felt the need to do &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/alcohol/Pages/dry-january-helped-me-take-back-control-of-my-drinking.aspx&#34;&gt;dry January&lt;/a&gt;. Also Ingrid and I sat in a restaurant in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mattischrome.com/spain-new-year-201718/&#34;&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; on January 2nd drinking for the third night in row. We hadn&amp;rsquo;t got off to that great a start. Well today marks the completion of a dry month: dry January with a two day lag.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also (mostly) managed to keep to my other goal of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/16/case-against-sugar-sweetness-and-blight-rachel-cooke&#34;&gt;eliminating sugar&lt;/a&gt; from my tea and coffee. This meant I cut out at least three teaspoons of sugar a day for a month. I can&amp;rsquo;t say it was easy. For a while I compensated by hoovering up the post-Christmas chocolates. Then came a period of the blues, though that was probably just &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias&#34;&gt;confirmation bias&lt;/a&gt;. They don&amp;rsquo;t call the third Monday of January &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/blog/truth-about-blue-monday&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;blue Monday&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; for nothing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
