      <title>The Orb, Live at Brighton Concord 2</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Went with my friend Nick to see The Orb at Concord 2 last night. The last time I&amp;rsquo;d seen the Orb was back in 2004, at the start of their relatively dry spell. That night, they&amp;rsquo;d been a bit lacklustre despite playing (some of) the hits and a relatively decent album in &amp;ldquo;Bicycles and Tricycles&amp;rdquo;. I left feeling that I&amp;rsquo;d seen the past rather than the future, something that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t glimpse again in their records until 2015.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I went to a pub quiz tonight</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ingrid and I joined our usual quiz team tonight for the residents&amp;rsquo; association pub quiz. As usual we came third. It&amp;rsquo;s a fairly settled group of attendees and we know our level. We&amp;rsquo;re also quite used to the quiz master and his questions, though I do wish he&amp;rsquo;d acknowledge that pop music continued to be a thing long after the sixties!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since moving to an M1 Mac, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed some issues with my second screen that I do not experience with my previous Intel Mac or with my current work laptop, which is a Dell Intel PC running Windows 10.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tade Thompson, Rosewater</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/tade-thompson-rosewater/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rosewater is an exciting science fiction novel set several decades after first contact with an alien called Wormwood, that has established itself as a large biodome in Nigeria. The novel follows Kaaro, a thief whose extra special abilities are forged from an unlikely connection with the alien. The whole thing is part sci-fi adventure and part spy novel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Doing the thing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I find it hard to get started on projects. This may have always been the case. I definitely remember instances of complex plans for school projects that I&amp;rsquo;d barely have time to finish. I once got up at 6AM to finish making a calendar in French—I thought it was going to be this outstanding piece of work that would genuinely replace my teacher&amp;rsquo;s calendar! Reality didn&amp;rsquo;t quite match the idea though.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Laurent Binet, Civilisations</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/laurent-binet-civilisations/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/laurent-binet-civilisations/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Civilisations&amp;rsquo; is a counterfactual historical novel that attempts to extrapolate the future course of history after changing one pivotal moment of the timeline. I usually find novels like this are great fun, another entertaining example is &amp;lsquo;Making History&amp;rsquo; by Stephen Fry. The novel, originally written in French, won some big awards in France last year. I read the translation by Sam Taylor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>TIL: footnotes in Latex captions</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/til-latex-footnotes-in-captions/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 08 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/til-latex-footnotes-in-captions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I had an interesting bug in some Latex code I am writing. Putting a footnote into a caption caused the document to fail compilation. The problem was that this document doesn&amp;rsquo;t use a table of figures at the start, so I hadn&amp;rsquo;t thought to include a short summary caption. Apparently the curly brace in the footnote command does not sit well with that, even if you aren&amp;rsquo;t using a list or table of figures in your document. The solution is simple, as long as the footnote isn&amp;rsquo;t crucial to the list of tables!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, we transferred our Christmas tree to a new pot. Being root-bound as the tree was, it took ages to get it out of the crappy pot from the store and into the new, bigger pot. And I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure it&amp;rsquo;s a bit wonky, which might make the baubles a bit lopsided next Christmas. It looks excellent next to the new bird bath.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifeforms&lt;/strong&gt; is the 1994 album from the Future Sound of London. A double album (just), it also features the talents of Robert Fripp, Ozric Tentacles, Talvin Singh, Toni Halliday, and Liz Frazer. It reached number 6 on the UK album chart and went silver.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is FFI anyway?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/what-is-ffi-anyway/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/what-is-ffi-anyway/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the moment I can’t compile this blog locally because my &lt;code&gt;ruby-ffi&lt;/code&gt; install is somehow wrong and is preventing Jekyll from running on my recently upgraded Mac system. Fortunately the site still compiles on Netlify, or else you wouldn’t be reading this!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A February Project</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/second-february-post/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/second-february-post/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hmmm it seems as though the &lt;code&gt;ffi&lt;/code&gt; gem as installed by bundler is not compatible with a Mac that has an M1 chip. This limits my ability to preview blog posts locally. I might have to swap to a more modern static site generator (which is probably easier than working out what &lt;code&gt;ffi&lt;/code&gt; actually does) - seems like a good February project!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite my best intentions, I didn’t manage to continue writing posts after the first day of 2022! But perhaps now I can try again as an excuse to test my blogging set up on my new computer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understated Classics Or Not?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the new year, thoughts and spare time for writing point me toward writing some new posts for my understated classics series. Expect some new ones soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
