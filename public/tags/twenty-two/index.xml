      <title>The Orb, Live at Brighton Concord 2</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Went with my friend Nick to see The Orb at Concord 2 last night. The last time I&amp;rsquo;d seen the Orb was back in 2004, at the start of their relatively dry spell. That night, they&amp;rsquo;d been a bit lacklustre despite playing (some of) the hits and a relatively decent album in &amp;ldquo;Bicycles and Tricycles&amp;rdquo;. I left feeling that I&amp;rsquo;d seen the past rather than the future, something that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t glimpse again in their records until 2015.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I went to a pub quiz tonight</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ingrid and I joined our usual quiz team tonight for the residents&amp;rsquo; association pub quiz. As usual we came third. It&amp;rsquo;s a fairly settled group of attendees and we know our level. We&amp;rsquo;re also quite used to the quiz master and his questions, though I do wish he&amp;rsquo;d acknowledge that pop music continued to be a thing long after the sixties!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s always a pot luck round. On one round we get to play a joker which doubles your points. I normally joke that we should play our joker on pot luck. The idea of countering the randomness of the round by getting double points appeals to me. I think we got a full house on pot luck this month, but we had not played our joker! (EDIT: I&amp;rsquo;m informed by Ingrid that we actually got 20/20 on a food and drink round called &amp;lsquo;Five a day&amp;rsquo;.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>M1 External Monitor Issues</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since moving to an M1 Mac, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed some issues with my second screen that I do not experience with my previous Intel Mac or with my current work laptop, which is a Dell Intel PC running Windows 10.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I get a lot of flickering on the screen, which is intolerable if I have Pro-motion and True Tone turned on. Note that these are options for the main display rather than the external monitor. I think this means that Apple does not or cannot let you apply these settings granularly, they have to be on or off system-wide.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tade Thompson, Rosewater</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rosewater is an exciting science fiction novel set several decades after first contact with an alien called Wormwood, that has established itself as a large biodome in Nigeria. The novel follows Kaaro, a thief whose extra special abilities are forged from an unlikely connection with the alien. The whole thing is part sci-fi adventure and part spy novel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The novel is set in multiple timelines with whole sections of the story told in flashback. This gives a sense of hopping through Kaaro’s memories and helps us explore this strange futuristic vision of Nigeria. It also really helps with pace, first by throwing us into the story and then helping to explain the relationships between the characters we are introduced to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I find it hard to get started on projects. This may have always been the case. I definitely remember instances of complex plans for school projects that I&amp;rsquo;d barely have time to finish. I once got up at 6AM to finish making a calendar in French—I thought it was going to be this outstanding piece of work that would genuinely replace my teacher&amp;rsquo;s calendar! Reality didn&amp;rsquo;t quite match the idea though.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>John Irving, The Imaginary Girlfriend</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/the-imaginary-girlfriend/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Imaginary Girlfriend&lt;/em&gt; is a short autobiography by American author John Irving. In it, he explains the interwoven roles of writing and wrestling in his life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As always with Irving, the book is absorbing from the off, and it&amp;rsquo;s tempting to use the anecdotes here to explain why most of his novels seem to have an underdog narrating them. It&amp;rsquo;s because he loves the work of Dickens so much. I kid. It might be because it is a role he has created for himself, and maybe he likes to write what he knows.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Laurent Binet, Civilisations</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/laurent-binet-civilisations/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Civilisations&amp;rsquo; is a counterfactual historical novel that attempts to extrapolate the future course of history after changing one pivotal moment of the timeline. I usually find novels like this are great fun, another entertaining example is &amp;lsquo;Making History&amp;rsquo; by Stephen Fry. The novel, originally written in French, won some big awards in France last year. I read the translation by Sam Taylor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In &amp;lsquo;Civilisations&amp;rsquo;, Binet makes the pivotal point of his tale, the migration of Erik the Red to America in the late 900s. The idea of the novel is that as the vikings move down the coast of north and Central America, they bring exposure to (and therefore some eventual immunity from) smallpox and the ability to work with iron. This equips and prepares the indigenous people ahead of Christopher Columbus&amp;rsquo; arrival in 1492.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>TIL: footnotes in Latex captions</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/til-latex-footnotes-in-captions/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I had an interesting bug in some Latex code I am writing. Putting a footnote into a caption caused the document to fail compilation. The problem was that this document doesn&amp;rsquo;t use a table of figures at the start, so I hadn&amp;rsquo;t thought to include a short summary caption. Apparently the curly brace in the footnote command does not sit well with that, even if you aren&amp;rsquo;t using a list or table of figures in your document. The solution is simple, as long as the footnote isn&amp;rsquo;t crucial to the list of tables!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Garden</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, we transferred our Christmas tree to a new pot. Being root-bound as the tree was, it took ages to get it out of the crappy pot from the store and into the new, bigger pot. And I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure it&amp;rsquo;s a bit wonky, which might make the baubles a bit lopsided next Christmas. It looks excellent next to the new bird bath.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, it was nice to get another plant into a pot with the hope of keeping it around. Currently, our garden is mostly bulbs erupting from pots. We covered what used to be the lawn in plastic sheeting last December to kill off the grass (and more importantly, the weeds). We had a look underneath it all last weekend, and it&amp;rsquo;s doing the job. It should be possible to continue the next phase of redoing the garden in March (depending on the weather). But it does mean that plant life is currently pot-bound, except for the shed-hugging Jasmine that Ingrid brought back to life a couple of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understated Classics #39: Lifeforms by Future Sound of London</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/understated-classics-39/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifeforms&lt;/strong&gt; is the 1994 album from the Future Sound of London. A double album (just), it also features the talents of Robert Fripp, Ozric Tentacles, Talvin Singh, Toni Halliday, and Liz Frazer. It reached number 6 on the UK album chart and went silver.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have wanted to write about the &lt;strong&gt;Lifeforms&lt;/strong&gt; album for a long time. In 2012, I even tried learning how to tell the tracks apart from one another. It was not a success. Ten years later, I know some of them but not all. I know all the music, of course, but the album as a whole resists my trainspotter-like urge to identify the margins and components of every track.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is FFI anyway?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/what-is-ffi-anyway/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the moment I can’t compile this blog locally because my &lt;code&gt;ruby-ffi&lt;/code&gt; install is somehow wrong and is preventing Jekyll from running on my recently upgraded Mac system. Fortunately the site still compiles on Netlify, or else you wouldn’t be reading this!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s always annoying when you rely on a complex multi-part system and some obscure part fails. It leaves you groping for answers and inventing unnecessary hack solutions. The dreaded old Stack Overflow rabbit hole. FFI stands for &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface&#34;&gt;Foreign Function Interface&lt;/a&gt;, a mechanism that allows code written in one language to be called by another language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A February Project</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/second-february-post/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hmmm it seems as though the &lt;code&gt;ffi&lt;/code&gt; gem as installed by bundler is not compatible with a Mac that has an M1 chip. This limits my ability to preview blog posts locally. I might have to swap to a more modern static site generator (which is probably easier than working out what &lt;code&gt;ffi&lt;/code&gt; actually does) - seems like a good February project!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite my best intentions, I didn’t manage to continue writing posts after the first day of 2022! But perhaps now I can try again as an excuse to test my blogging set up on my new computer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understated Classics Or Not?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/understated-classics-or-not/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/understated-classics-or-not/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the new year, thoughts and spare time for writing point me toward writing some new posts for my understated classics series. Expect some new ones soon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also reflected on my previous choices and thought a bit about how my music tastes have changed recently. Some of this has to do with streaming and the frustrations I wrote about &lt;a href=&#34;https://mattischrome.com/a-pox-on-both-their-houses&#34;&gt;in my last post&lt;/a&gt;. Some of it is just down to getting older: I have less time to listen to new music, and much of the &amp;rsquo;new&amp;rsquo; stuff I listen to is me investigating the stuff I missed first time around. Who knew Art of Noise were so good? Not me, but I do now!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
