      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sit back and let it happen, / Let us take your time away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nearly God&lt;/em&gt; is Tricky’s second album, which was released under a different name either because Island rejected it as the follow-up to &lt;em&gt;Maxinequaye&lt;/em&gt; or because it came too quickly after and Tricky just wanted it released. I had this album before &lt;em&gt;Maxinequaye&lt;/em&gt; because back then it wasn’t as easy to go back and catch up with albums that you had missed as it is now. I had bought enough singles to get the postcards through the post that advertised &lt;em&gt;Nearly God&lt;/em&gt; (this, kids, is what we had before e-mail and liking things on Facebook) and when I heard &lt;em&gt;Poems&lt;/em&gt; for the first time on the radio I was incredibly excited.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
