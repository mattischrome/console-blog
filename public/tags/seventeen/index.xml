      <description>&lt;p&gt;For new year Ingrid and I met up with Ingrid&amp;rsquo;s friend Ros at Barcelona airport. We went from there to Cadaqués on the Costa Brava. A winding drive over steep hills leads you down to a cute bay with the typical white houses and terracotta roofs. All the window frames were painted just the right shade of blue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/iceland-part-two&#34;&gt;We left Gulfoss&lt;/a&gt; and drove through the countryside to Fluðir where our next hotel stay would be. The hotel had cute little cabins arranged around a central square and the room itself was comfy and warm. Our dinner was nice enough, although we had a bit of a Fawlty Towers moment with Ingrid’s chicken salad. First it went back because they didn’t leave the BBQ sauce off. Then it came back &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; tomatoes. And then back again with more BBQ sauce. Fourth time lucky.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a perfect confluence of &lt;a href=&#34;album-digest-october-2011&#34;&gt;last month&amp;rsquo;s album digest&lt;/a&gt;, here&amp;rsquo;s an excellent Four Tet remix of Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;I Will Make Room For You&amp;rdquo; from her album &amp;ldquo;The Kid&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve put it into a playlist with &amp;ldquo;Lush&amp;rdquo; from Four Tet&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;New Energy&amp;rdquo; album and the original version of &amp;ldquo;I Will Make Room For You.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After I read &lt;a href=&#34;hello-america&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hello America&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;like-a-mule-ice-cream-sun-manyika&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Like a Mule Bringing Ice Cream to the Sun&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; to Ingrid, it was her turn to read something to me. We settled on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.matthaig.com/reasons-to-stay-alive/&#34;&gt;Matt Haig&amp;rsquo;s memoir of anxiety and depression &amp;ldquo;Reasons to Stay Alive&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, which is as uplifting and life-affirming as its title suggests.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Beetroot Bolognaise</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/beetroot-bolognaise/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/beetroot-bolognaise/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We cook this version of bolognaise with beetroot due to Ingrid&amp;rsquo;s tomato allergy. This recipe is an attempt to capture what we do on the fly. The key to it is using the wine, the Worcestershire sauce and the herbs to even out the sweetness of the beetroot. If you can manage that, it&amp;rsquo;s super tasty. The sauce usually ends up being an unusual but pleasing pink/purple colour, as you will see from the pictures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had to compute an indicator this week. It had confidence intervals that relied on taking 100,000 samples from the indicator&amp;rsquo;s approximate distribution. I had to repeat this over multiple GP practices and for twelve different demographic groups.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks I have worn a suit to work. I bought a new furry woolly suit a few weeks ago and have alternated between it and my old one. I also bought new shoes that gave me blisters and made me cry. Enough time has passed that by now it feels natural rather than silly and those shoes don&amp;rsquo;t eat my feet as much as they used to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Three Years</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Three years ago today I moved in to my little flat in Chichester, soon to start a new job. I had no money left but at least, after a character building stint of six months sleeping on the floor, I had a bed. In the intervening three years, my job role has expanded, I&amp;rsquo;ve done another degree, the flat has become a home, and I&amp;rsquo;ve met and married Ingrid. Add to that the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s almost four years since I left for South America and I start to realise that I&amp;rsquo;ve done a crazy amount of things in that time. I don&amp;rsquo;t intend to stop.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sarah Ladipo Manyika, Like a Mule Bringing Ice Cream to the Sun</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Like a Mule Bringing Ice Cream to the Sun&amp;rdquo; is a novella by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sarahladipomanyika.com&#34;&gt;Sarah Ladipo Manyika&lt;/a&gt;. Of all the books nominated for the 2016 Goldsmiths Prize, this looked like the most interesting to my eyes. I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed previous Goldsmiths nominated novels including &lt;a href=&#34;acts-of-the-assassins-richard-beard&#34;&gt;Acts of the Assassins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;satin-island-tom-mccarthy-review&#34;&gt;Satin Island&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understated Classics #36: The Coral by The Coral</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/understated-classics-36/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps in today&amp;rsquo;s modern age of streaming and such, &lt;a href=&#34;http://thecoral.co.uk&#34;&gt;The Coral&lt;/a&gt; would be a bigger band and may have survived their eventual burnout. Their work ethic was evident from the start, as rumours swirled &lt;a href=&#34;https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/YdkAAOSwfl9XBSiR/s-l300.jpg&#34;&gt;in the NME&lt;/a&gt; about a fantastic new band from Liverpool who were going to blow everybody&amp;rsquo;s socks off. I went to see them live in Bristol after they&amp;rsquo;d released three EPs and they were incredible. Their sound, a bit like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071615/&#34;&gt;the movie &amp;ldquo;Holy Mountain&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; set to pop music, imagined a Merseybeat channelled from an alternative universe in which Lennon and McCartney took their acid in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.desertusa.com/mojave-desert.html&#34;&gt;the Mojave desert&lt;/a&gt; rather than in the English suburbs. Yes, it was derivative but somehow it also managed to be utterly new and compelling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A trip to Iceland. Part 2: Reykjavík to Flu∂ir.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/iceland-part-one&#34;&gt;After a day on foot in Reykjavík&lt;/a&gt;, and with some trepidation, we returned to the car for our drive through Iceland&amp;rsquo;s countryside. We started by heading out on route 1, which is like Iceland&amp;rsquo;s M25 except that it encircles an entire country &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; about thirty times fewer people. We went to house of Nobel Prize winner Halldór Laxness, only to be turned away because it was being renovated and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t open for another month. Undeterred, we pressed on toward &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Eingvellir&#34;&gt;Þingvellir&lt;/a&gt;, stopping off on the way to take pictures at a viewpoint. It was just crazy, a flat expanse of undisturbed snow. Just as with the drive from the airport, the territory should have been relentlessly bleak but instead we got a winter wonderland.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We went to see the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/georgia-okeeffe&#34;&gt;Georgia O&amp;rsquo;Keeffe exhibition at the Tate Modern&lt;/a&gt; last year. At the time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know much about her, other than the fact she was famous for painting flowers. And that people get a bit hot under the collar about what those paintings might represent. Was the art world of the 1920s and 1930s so repressed that it managed to get into a lather about some paintings of flowers? And more importantly, are they any good?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://approachingpavonis.blogspot.co.uk&#34;&gt;Alistair Reynolds&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt; 2000 novel &amp;ldquo;Revelation Space&amp;rdquo; has long been in orbit of my science fiction &amp;ldquo;to read&amp;rdquo; list, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until one sleepless night (post &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/command-and-control/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Command and Control&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;) that I came across it in Ingrid&amp;rsquo;s audiobooks. I was instantly drawn in as I listened to the opening scene about an archaeological dig facing evacuation ahead of an imminent &amp;lsquo;razor storm&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love making plots in R with &lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt;. However, there are always a few niggles that I forget about between plots. I wrote this post so that I have somewhere to look the next time I need to tweak a few things in my plots. I intend to come back and add updates in the future as I learn more things. If I keep coming back, I might also remember a few of these too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Reykjavík a few days &lt;a href=&#34;https://weather.com/news/news/reykjavik-iceland-record-snowfall-february&#34;&gt;after a monumental snowstorm&lt;/a&gt;. As such the city was still under at least six inches of snow. We collected the hire car from the airport and drove out of Keflavik. The scenery normally looks like a moonscape, but for us it was a frosty white wonderland.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had low expectations for &amp;ldquo;Hello America&amp;rdquo;, the next in &lt;a href=&#34;j-g-ballard&#34;&gt;the series of Ballard novels&lt;/a&gt; that I started reading over seven years ago. However, it turned out to be a hoot. A couple of years ago, this novel would have been a wig-out bit of standard Ballard weirdness (a bit like &lt;a href=&#34;the-drowned-world&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Drowned World&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;the-crystal-world&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Crystal World&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;) but given recent events &amp;ldquo;Hello America&amp;rdquo; is starting to take on an eerie prescience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ingrid and I got married a month ago. It was a lovely day. We had a simple ceremony with two witnesses, our friends Sue and Andrew. We kept it quiet and small, as we just wanted to be married without too much fuss. A month on, we&amp;rsquo;re happy to report that we are glad we did it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Note: Recent months have been very busy, so this album digest combines a review of the new album by The National with a couple of reviews left over from earlier in the year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve written a few more album reviews in the past months but I&amp;rsquo;m so far behind (February and March have already been published on a considerable lag) that I&amp;rsquo;m just going to pepper forthcoming digests with additional reviews of older albums.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Command and Control&amp;rdquo; by Eric Schlosser is about the history of nuclear weapons and their safety. This might not seem like a thrilling subject, but it&amp;rsquo;s absorbing from start to finish. I started it three years ago but only finished it more recently as the subject of nuclear weapons has become more pertinent to current affairs.&lt;label for=&#34;sidenote-2ba6a6675eed1cbcd81947545d956648-0&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sidenote-2ba6a6675eed1cbcd81947545d956648-0&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&#xA;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;Suffice to say that when I bought the book over three years ago, I would not have believed that it would be so much more relevant by the time I had finished it.&lt;/span&gt; There are many people who would stand to gain a great deal from reading this book.&lt;label for=&#34;sidenote-2ba6a6675eed1cbcd81947545d956648-1&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle sidenote-number&#34;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;&lt;input type=&#34;checkbox&#34; id=&#34;sidenote-2ba6a6675eed1cbcd81947545d956648-1&#34; class=&#34;margin-toggle&#34;/&gt;&#xA;&lt;span class=&#34;sidenote&#34;&gt;The name at the top of the list rhymes with Dump.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We bought a cheap package holiday in the British Airways Black Friday sale. The weekend spanned Ingrid&amp;rsquo;s birthday, so it was ideal. £99 each for flights and a hotel, and we bagged a hire car quite cheaply too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understated Classics #35: Snivilisation by Orbital</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/understated-classics-35/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/understated-classics-35/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I came late to Orbital&amp;rsquo;s work. I knew of them through a few remixes and because as a mad Orb fan, they could not have avoided my notice could they? Apart from that, one of my college friends tried to get me into &amp;ldquo;In Sides&amp;rdquo; just after its release in 1996. The same friend got me into &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/understated-classics-11/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Second Toughest In The Infants&amp;rdquo; by Underworld&lt;/a&gt;. I cannot now understand the reason, but &amp;ldquo;In Sides&amp;rdquo; just left me cold.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my last post, I wrote about hills. I tried to use them as a metaphor to explain nagging sense of incompletion when you single out one activity over another. The feeling that there&amp;rsquo;s always a more exciting hill off in the distance to go climb, instead of the one you&amp;rsquo;re on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of books. The way they transport you away to other places and so on. As repositories of knowledge and adventure they can&amp;rsquo;t be beat. I can think of no better way out of an existential fix than reading.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Wonder Woman: A Short Review</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed Wonder Woman, which came as a surprise to me given my growing distaste for superhero movies. &lt;a href=&#34;man-of-steel-a-short-review&#34;&gt;I can remember seeing the Superman reboot Man of Steel&lt;/a&gt; with its phallic rockets and its boring boring fight sequences. But almost everything about Wonder Woman exceeded my expectations. It&amp;rsquo;s a well-made superhero movie and better still, it gets to the heart of why these kinds of movies matter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It can be a struggle to keep writing. I&amp;rsquo;ve found this happened a lot since I moved the blog. First, there was  the business of moving things over. That meant a lot of thought about old posts and which ones I should keep. A lot of the time I thought &amp;ldquo;how on earth did I have time to write this?!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Programming a Carcassonne Game</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although I have put off finishing &lt;a href=&#34;programming-an-uno-game&#34;&gt;my UNO game&lt;/a&gt; for over eighteen months, I thought I would get started with another pet project of mine: making a Carcassonne game. This is not a serious affair, there is an excellent app of Carcassonne available for those of you who have iOS devices (it works particularly well on the iPad). The game just strikes me as having the right level of complexity to be a taxing yet attainable project. I’d also like to understand strategies for playing the game and what better way to evaluate strategies for games of chance than to have a simulator to play all those millions of games that you don’t have time to play?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
