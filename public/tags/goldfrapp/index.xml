      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the first in an unplanned series of &lt;strong&gt;album revisits&lt;/strong&gt;, I will write a post explaining the process soon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Cherry_(Goldfrapp_album)&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Black Cherry&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; is the second album by Goldfrapp, released in 2003. I bought the lead single Train while I lived in York and also the single of the title track because by then I&amp;rsquo;d discovered M83 and they&amp;rsquo;d done a remix of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Black Cherry&amp;rdquo; finds the band faced with following their successful and chilled out debut album &amp;ldquo;Felt Mountain&amp;rdquo;, which back in 2000 had sounded notably weird. But nobody wants to sound like a kook forever, sometimes people want to let their hair down and just dance. That&amp;rsquo;s very much what the first two tracks anyway, especially the pulsating &amp;ldquo;Train&amp;rdquo;. To my ears, I was definitely pleased when I first played the single - I love that relentless synth riff that sounds like it&amp;rsquo;s being fed through about seventy FX pedals. I vaguely remember the single&amp;rsquo;s B-side &amp;ldquo;Big Black Cloud, Little White Lie&amp;rdquo; and the Village Hall Remix being pretty ace too. Fortunately they&amp;rsquo;re also on streaming, so I was able to check. I think I liked the B-side because it sounded very much like a &amp;ldquo;Felt Mountain&amp;rdquo; outtake - twenty years ago I likely appreciated the familiarity but today it serves a reminder that while &amp;ldquo;Felt Mountain 2&amp;rdquo; would have been nice, &amp;ldquo;Black Cherry&amp;rdquo; definitely benefitted from changing things up a bit. The Remix is mostly instrumental and adds even more Glitter beat stomp to Train, pleasant enough I guess.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Note: Recent months have been very busy, so this album digest combines a review of the new album by The National with a couple of reviews left over from earlier in the year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve written a few more album reviews in the past months but I&amp;rsquo;m so far behind (February and March have already been published on a considerable lag) that I&amp;rsquo;m just going to pepper forthcoming digests with additional reviews of older albums.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A nice diverse selection of albums this month:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Arctic Monkeys &amp;ldquo;AM&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;BT &amp;ldquo;A Song Across Wires&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Goldfrapp &amp;ldquo;Tales of Us&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Janelle Mon√°e &amp;ldquo;Electric Lady&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;arctic-monkeys-am&#34;&gt;Arctic Monkeys &amp;ldquo;AM&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This whole review is basically me catching up with the rest of the world and realising that the Arctic Monkeys are ace. To be fair, I did notice how awesome they were at the opening ceremony of the Olympics last year, and I have liked the odd one or two of their singles, but up until now I haven&amp;rsquo;t really wanted to listen to any of their albums. In fact before &amp;ldquo;AM&amp;rdquo;, I already had two (ripped from the CDs of friends) but had never bothered to listen to them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
