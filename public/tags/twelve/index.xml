      <title>Album Digest, December 2012</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Three albums (one very Christmassey one!) and an EP this month.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tracey Thorn “Tinsel and Lights”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Woob “Have Landed”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tim Hecker and Daniel Lopatin “Instrumental Tourist”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Burial “Truant / Rough Sleeper&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;tracey-thorn-tinsel-and-lights&#34;&gt;Tracey Thorn “Tinsel and Lights”&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Tinsel and Lights” is that rarest of records, a Christmas record that is perfectly suited to the season and is not in any way overbearing or irritating. Most albums that are Christmas themed are usually centred on lots of covers that are taken from a small subset of well worn classics. The songs on “Tinsel And Lights” are either originals or slightly more obscure covers and this works to its great advantage. The most famous song here (“Have yourself a merry little Christmas” aside) is probably the White Stripes’ “In The Cold Cold Night” and that’s not really a Christmas song (though it works better here than I’d anticipated).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pretty much a sliding scale between songs and electronic wibble on this month’s albums and a particularly damp, chilly feeling to proceedings too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bat For Lashes “The Haunted Man”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ital “Hive Mind” and “Dream On”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Björk “Bastards”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Brian Eno “Lux”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;bat-for-lashes-the-haunted-man&#34;&gt;Bat For Lashes “The Haunted Man”&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to Bat For Lashes, I prefer her first album “Fur And Gold” to her second “Two Suns” because when I listen to the latter I don’t feel connected to any of the songs. For me, “Fur And Gold” remains a wonderful adventure throughout, it’s a fantastic listen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Mountain Story</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A cat reaches the top of a mountain after a long climb through the snow. He is cold from the bottom of his fur to the tips of his claws. He is sodden and wet, and we all know how much a cat hates to be wet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the top of the mountain there is not much to see. What may have been a breathtaking view is instead a murk of freezing mist and at any rate, snow assails the cat’s eyes and whiskers. He shivers and sneezes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understated Classics #21: Woob 2 by Woob</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The second Woob album (AKA “Woob 4495”) is probably the greatest ambient album ever made and is certainly the best one you have never heard of. Originally released in 1995 &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.emit.cc&#34;&gt;on the em:t label&lt;/a&gt; it is also a rare record. I don’t have an actual copy but I have seen one! I downloaded it off the internet and even that is quite difficult to do. My friend is an avid collector of all the em:t releases and it is easy to see why: all the albums are titled in a specific way that is very appealing to people who like to collect things and they also have very striking nature photography on the covers. In a strange way, the label was able to create an identity for its releases in a way that many artists would try to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, when I am feeling a bit down, I like to write down some of my ambitions. As you can see from this list they are mostly pretty humble but they are also a bit cheesy and embarassing, so I have put them after the fold!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Be wholehearted, cheerful, and sincere&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Be creative&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Look at the world and see its many faces, hear its many voices&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Explore new recipes as often as possible when I cook&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Learn to like the taste of tomatoes and cucumbers&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Be more at ease around people&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Listen to people and hear what they say&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Play my part&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Look after someone special&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Become a parent&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Share my values with others, help those who need it&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Break up all the negative things inside me&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Know what other people want, help them get it&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When I wake up each morning I would like to remember my dreams&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Understand art more than I do&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lose my fear of creepy crawlies&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Learn to drive&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Learn to write left handed (why not?)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Visit every country in Europe&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Visit the radio telescopes on Mauna Kea in Hawaii&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Let go of unnecessary things&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ditch social networks and the rest of the internet as much as possible&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Learn to appreciate the noise around me&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Meditate&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Get over my reliance on sugar to improve my mood&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Get rid of things I don’t need&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Grow the garden&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Write people letters&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Learn the differences between species of trees&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Be flexible and adaptable and positive about the future&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Learn how to hang a picture on a wall&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <title>Rust And Bone: A Short Review</title>
      <link>https://mattischrome.com/posts/rust-and-bone-a-short-review/</link>

      <guid>https://mattischrome.com/posts/rust-and-bone-a-short-review/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, two short reviews in a row. I had the day off work and went to see “Rust And Bone” this afternooon. It’s the new film by Jacques Audiard, who directed “A Prophet” – one of my favourite films of the last five years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Rust And Bone” is a love story about Ali, a sexually feckless security guard who is struggling to look after his young son on his own, and Stéphanie (played by second most beautiful woman in the world, Marion Cotillard), who is injured while working as a co-ordinator of killer whale displays at an ocenarium. Needless to say it is not a minor injury. The film is basically their love story. I don’t feel so much responsibility to hide plot details about this film because, to be frank, I could type out the whole plot here and it wouldn’t convey the reasons why it’s so great.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I went to see &amp;ldquo;Skyfall&amp;rdquo; last night and I really enjoyed it. I knew nothing about the plot, mostly because I had avoided all discussion of the plot with people who had already seen it and I even avoided reviews as so many these days seem to just rattle off plot points, instead of discussing what makes the movie any good. With that in mind I will obviously try not to give away any of the plot in this brief review.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Album Digest, October 2012</title>

      <guid>https://mattischrome.com/posts/album-digest-october-2012/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a strange month and I found that I didn’t listen to a lot of new music. I have been a bit down and when that’s the case I tend to take refuge in music that I know well, stuff that cheers me up. I have listened to last month’s fave a lot, Nelly Furtado’s “The Spirit Indestructible”. I said a lot of nice things about it but it probably didn’t come over in my writing just how much I really liked it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Stevenage vs Portsmouth</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, despite feeling a bit under the weather, I went to Stevenage to watch Portsmouth play a League One game at the Lamex Stadium. In addition, I met a “person off the internet” for the second time in a week – this time Tom, a friend of a friend from Facebook: our shared passions being Portsmouth FC and really cool music. We met at King’s Cross and caught a packed train to Stevenage, a non-descript dormitory town that was even more non-descript than I remember St Albans being. I’m glad I went, even though Pompey lost. It’s funny how sitting in a shed in the cold watching your team lose counts as entertainment!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Systems: A Rough Intro</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is another mathematics post that does not actually feature any equations or graphs. It is intended to set the way clear for writing regularly about nonlinear systems. This in itself is a precursor to writing more about mathematical biology as biological systems are inherently complex and nonlinear. I am reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Nonlinear-Systems-Cambridge-Applied-Mathematics/dp/0521406684/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1349212296&amp;amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;P. G. Drazin’s textbook on Nonlinear Systems&lt;/a&gt; and this post is a glossary of terms from the start of the book laid down here because I wanted to remember how to typeset &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_dl.asp&#34;&gt;definition lists&lt;/a&gt; in Markdown (though in the end I (ab)used &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags because it looked better).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a bit more time to listen to this month’s albums because I was on holiday for two weeks. I didn’t manage to write about them while on holiday though! In fact I bought and listened to a few more, but I will save them for next month. The albums I will discuss now (in order bought) are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Four Tet “Pink”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The xx “Coexist”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Nelly Furtado “The Spirit Indestructible”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Grizzly Bear “Shields”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s quite a diverse collection and, Four Tet apart, quite song based.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over my holiday I read &amp;ldquo;Even The Dogs&amp;rdquo; by Jon McGregor. I&amp;rsquo;ve not quite finished it yet but that will at least prevent me from giving away spoilers. I am not sure I would want to give any spoilers anyway because it is unrelentingly grim so far. Perhaps there is a happy  ending but both you and I will have to read it to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was introduced to Jon McGregor by the book group I was part of during my PhD. I think &amp;ldquo;If Nobody Speaks Of Remarkable Things&amp;rdquo; was the first book I read for the group. At that time of my life, about eight or so years after finishing my English Literature A-level, I had not had to read a book that I had not chosen for myself for quite a long time. I found it to be a complete shock. I can still remember reading about half that book straight out of the amazon packaging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Programming a Carcassonne Game</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although I have put off finishing &lt;a href=&#34;programming-an-uno-game&#34;&gt;my UNO game&lt;/a&gt; for over eighteen months, I thought I would get started with another pet project of mine: making a Carcassonne game. This is not a serious affair, there is an excellent app of Carcassonne available for those of you who have iOS devices (it works particularly well on the iPad). The game just strikes me as having the right level of complexity to be a taxing yet attainable project. I’d also like to understand strategies for playing the game and what better way to evaluate strategies for games of chance than to have a simulator to play all those millions of games that you don’t have time to play?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understated Classics #20: Folklore by Nelly Furtado</title>

      <guid>https://mattischrome.com/posts/understated-classics-20/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s rather spooky but shortly after deciding to write about Nelly Furtado’s “Folklore” as the next &lt;a href=&#34;understated-classics&#34;&gt;understated classic&lt;/a&gt;, I found out that she has a new album out this week. As a result, I have been listening to a lot of her music while writing this post, and I’ve been enjoying it too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As always with these choices of mine, “Folklore” is a record that I can link to particular events and emotions in my life and so I guess my perception of it is coloured by that. Nevertheless while re-listening to the album I tried to examine whether my feelings for it were &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; centred on those memories and emotional responses. I think the answer is not a simple one, because in recent weeks I’ve felt very unsettled in many aspects of my life and so I probably have found it difficult to tell.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Album Digest August 2012 is also from the stack of albums that I &lt;a href=&#34;album-digest-july-2012&#34;&gt;mentioned last month&lt;/a&gt;. I chose this selection (along with the Passion Pit album) because the colours looked good together in the mosaic of covers that I make each month. Last month’s digest was about the right amount of detail so this will be another briefer digest. These are all good albums but not ones that will change your life, they&amp;rsquo;ll just happily sit alongside it. They are:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“The Gone-Away World” is a novel by Nick Harkaway. It’s about a world slightly askew to our own in which the powers-that-be have deigned to unleash a weapon that simply wipes the enemy out of existence. Unfortunately the enemies also have the same weapon and there are terrible consequences to the extent that the very fabric of reality is threatened. If you don’t already know what reification means, you will by the end.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Two weeks before her first ever performance of “Running Up That Hill”, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nme.com/blog/index.php?blog=10&amp;amp;title=on_this_day_kate_bush_releases_hounds_of_1986&amp;amp;more=1&amp;amp;c=1&amp;amp;tb=1&amp;amp;pb=1&#34;&gt;the NME had written an editorial asking whether she had burnt herself out completely&lt;/a&gt;. Obviously “Running Up That Hill” (recently used to great effect in the Olympic Closing Ceremony) and the parent album “The Hounds Of Love” that followed showed that she had plenty more up her sleeve.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a short album digest this month. I bought a stack of CDs and am parcelling them out over the next few months (together with important additional releases as they crop up). This is in the hope that I can write more considered pieces about each one. This month I’ve grouped together albums with monochrome covers and a BT album from June that I found out about recently. These albums are not just linked by their artwork, they also form a cohesive whole. As a result I dispense with reviewing each album in depth. As usual there is a playlist at the end.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Three fantastic albums for Album Digest June 2012:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Saint Etienne &lt;em&gt;Words and Music by Saint Etienne&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Liars &lt;em&gt;WIXIW&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hot Chip &lt;em&gt;In Our Heads&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This month is a curious selection in that the albums are all by bands that I already own a few records by. When there is so much other directly related material that you can write about, it makes focussing on the album in hand quite difficult. I am always thinking up rankings and comparisons. Where does this new album fit in with the rest of them? Will I like it as much when the novelty wears off? What would it sound like if they had done Y or Z like they did back on album X?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is about the films of Wes Anderson. I am no expert, I’ve just watched them all recently (inspired by &lt;a href=&#34;moonrise-kingdom-a-short-review&#34;&gt;seeing “Moonrise Kingdom”&lt;/a&gt;) and spotted a some similarities and differences between the films and I thought it would be fun to write about them. My appearance on Mastermind with “The Films of Wes Anderson” as my specialist subject will have to wait for now. Feel free to add to the discussion in the comments. In case you don’t know what the films are, here they are in order (with links to their IMDB pages):&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../../assets/images/other/June-2012-Bookstack.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;More books to add to the “University of life” course list&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More books to add to the “University of life” course list. From top to bottom: I picked up “Generation X” for 50p in a charity shop in Tintagel. “Everything Is Going To Be OK” is a picture book full of inspirational mottos. “The Happiness Hypothesis” is the most useful and interesting book that I have read in a long while. I decided to read “How To Write A Sentence” as an alternative to Strunk and White’s “The Elements Of Style” which, while useful, can be a little stuffy! “The Marriage Plot” is a novel with interesting reviews, it was also (ahem) well-priced. After love I decided to go after music as something else I wanted to read about, hence “The Music Instinct” which comes highly recommended. “The Gifts Of Imperfection” is a manifesto for embracing life in a wholehearted way. And “Gonzo”? Well, &lt;a href=&#34;https://mattischrome.com/gonzo-a-graphic-biography-of-hunter-s-thompson/&#34;&gt;I have written about that one already&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Helen Fisher, Some Lessons In Love</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As indicated by my &lt;a href=&#34;articles/reading-list-mid-april-2012&#34;&gt;reading list&lt;/a&gt; posted a couple of months ago (which has since been added to &lt;a href=&#34;articles/another-reading-list&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), I’ve started to try to read more about the things that I felt that I did not understand so well. Most notably perhaps is this book “on love” by Helen Fisher. Lest there is any innuendo it is not a book about technique nor does it attempt to explain love to those who have never known it, instead it assumes that we have all been there. In fact, the book attempts to explain the neurological mechanisms of love (specifically romantic love) and describes how science has helped reveal these mechanisms to us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>CAN, The Lost Tapes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This arrived on Monday and I thought I would give it a post of its own because at over 3 hours of music, I am unlikely to do more than dip into it before writing the album digest next week. It is a far bigger and more enjoyable artefact than I thought it was going to be, so it probably deserves special attention for that reason too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_(band)&#34;&gt;CAN&lt;/a&gt; are a German (“&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krautrock&#34;&gt;Krautrock&lt;/a&gt;”) band that I got into about four years ago after my interest in the genre was sparked by the “Neu! 75” album and the Kraftwerk box set. I have four of CAN&amp;rsquo;s albums and I have thought about which one I should include as an &lt;a href=&#34;understated-classics&#34;&gt;understated classic&lt;/a&gt;. It will probably be “Soon Over Babaluma” because no one really writes about that one. Then again, Portishead’s “Third” probably wouldn’t sound as awesome as it does without the influence of “Ege Bamyasi”, so that might be worth considering too. Everyone writes about “Tago Mago” and “Future Days” but for good reason.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another book from the “university of life” pile (though &lt;a href=&#34;reading-list-mid-april-2012&#34;&gt;not in the picture&lt;/a&gt;), “Gonzo” is the biography of Hunter S. Thompson in graphical form. In case you don’t know his work, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_S._Thompson&#34;&gt;Hunter S. Thompson&lt;/a&gt; was a journalist who invented the so-called “gonzo” style. This was basically to rock up at some major event and become embedded within it, usually writing up a long form piece from an outsider perspective. He was particularly famous for his work on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell%27s_Angels:_The_Strange_and_Terrible_Saga_of_the_Outlaw_Motorcycle_Gangs&#34;&gt;Hell’s Angels&lt;/a&gt; and Richard Nixon’s campaign for presidential re-election in 1972.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight I avoided the first half of the football along with my friend Albert Jan and we went to watch “Moonrise Kingdom” at the wonderful Everyman cinema in Hampstead. It was a real treat in every sense. To start with, the Everyman is a lovely cinema. It is quite expensive but you do get what you pay for: a comfortable seat in a great theatre and the chance to watch more than just the latest blockbusters (though it shows those too). I think it was the only cinema in my area that was showing &lt;em&gt;Moonrise Kingdom&lt;/em&gt;, though it has been out for a while now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Say what? We’re allowing compilations now?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes. Why not? A good mix is as much an artistic statement as a full-blown single artist album. It takes a lot of skill to get from A to B and keep everything on the boil in between. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fabriclondon.com/store/catalog/product/view/id/30/s/fabric-12/categories/8/&#34;&gt;This Fabric mix by The Amalgamation Of Soundz&lt;/a&gt; is one of my favourites because it is a downtempo (but, crucially, not &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; downtempo) compilation delivered with flair and using what I consider to be unconventional sources (soundtracks, tribute albums, hip-hop) to do it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Four albums for Album Digest May 2012:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Jack White &lt;em&gt;Blunderbuss&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;One Little Plane &lt;em&gt;Into The Trees&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Beach House &lt;em&gt;Bloom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Oxia &lt;em&gt;Tides Of Mind&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;album-digest-april-2012&#34;&gt;April album digest&lt;/a&gt; was rather short on songs, so this month I decided to look for albums that were more based around songs not tracks. Electronic music is relatively easy to write about: the music is often simple (but not always), there are recognisable structures and genres (but not always), and there are conventions that are adhered to (but not always). The repetition of those parenthetical “not always” means that while the writing is easy, it is also often quite fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A mostly instrumental month with a comeback from Orbital, an excellent remix collection from Battles, an amazing movie documenting a live performance by the Chemical Brothers and Austin Wintory’s soundtrack to the game &lt;em&gt;Journey&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Orbital &lt;em&gt;Wonky&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Battles &lt;em&gt;Dross Glop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Chemical Brothers &lt;em&gt;Don’t Think&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Austin Wintory &lt;em&gt;Journey (Original Soundtrack)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;orbital-_wonky_&#34;&gt;Orbital &lt;em&gt;Wonky&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am quite keen on Orbital, though perhaps not as keen as I am on the similarly named Orb. I think I have got all the Orbital albums, mostly bought on eBay after the fact. (Funny story though, I did find a copy of &lt;em&gt;In Sides&lt;/em&gt; in the loft of a house where I lived in Bath, along with several other albums…) My favourite Orbital album is probably &lt;em&gt;Snivilisation&lt;/em&gt; but they all have their moments, whether it is the genuine sliver of emotion shot through &lt;em&gt;Halcyon&lt;/em&gt; off the brown album, the proggy long-form tracks on &lt;em&gt;In Sides&lt;/em&gt; like &lt;em&gt;The Girl With The Sun In Her Head&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Out There Somewhere&lt;/em&gt; (parts one and two), or indeed the arsing about with heavy metal samples on tracks like &lt;em&gt;Tension&lt;/em&gt; off the highly underrated &lt;em&gt;The Altogether&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I had this album before &lt;em&gt;Maxinequaye&lt;/em&gt; because back then it wasn’t as easy to go back and catch up with albums that you had missed as it is now. I had bought enough singles to get the postcards through the post that advertised &lt;em&gt;Nearly God&lt;/em&gt; (this, kids, is what we had before e-mail and liking things on Facebook) and when I heard &lt;em&gt;Poems&lt;/em&gt; for the first time on the radio I was incredibly excited.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lonely Londoners&lt;/em&gt; by Sam Selvon was written in 1956 and tells of the experiences of West Indian men moving to London for work. It has been described as the definitive novel about the experiences of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/museum/item.asp?item_id=50&#34;&gt;Windrush settlers&lt;/a&gt;. The narrative centres on a man named Moses who was one of the first to come to London and finds himself the first port of call for many subsequent immigrants:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It look to old Moses that he hardly have time to settle in the old Brit’n before all sorts of fellars start coming straight to his room in the Water when they land up in London from the West Indies, saying that so and so tell them that Moses is a good fellar to contact, that he would help them get place to stay and work to do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I pay to have this blog up and running. That is, I pay for the space where it is stored and I pay for the name. I have to look after all the files and plug-ins, I have to perform all the updates and optimise the database tables. All this is great fun but wouldn’t it be cheaper to slap the mattischro.me address onto a hosted WordPress.com account?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, yes it would. I suppose I just like the independence of having my own little patch of cyberspace, sitting there waiting for all you dear readers to come and visit. Nice ideas don’t make the world go round though and so I need a better reason than that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

One of these is a “catch-up” (the album by Grails) but apart from that one, everything else was released in the last five weeks or so… I should probably have included the album by Racehorses that I bought on my birthday but I will have to leave that for next month as I haven’t listened to it that much. In fact, it is still in my housemate’s car!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It’s a subtle collection of music that sits at the margins of your consciousness: for a long time it was the music that I turned to when I could not sleep but I could just as easily imagine it as (ahem!) romantic background music as I could something to work to. I actually bought it in 2006 to listen to on an overnight flight back from the US.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

(Interestingly, out of the two out-and-out song based albums, one was one of the worst albums of the year and the other one of the best).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;j-g-ballard&#34;&gt;Ages ago&lt;/a&gt; I set out to write a post for each of JG Ballard’s novels. In fact it is the oldest post on this blog. Most of the novels (I don’t have the two autobiographical novels &lt;em&gt;Empire Of The Sun&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Kindness Of Women&lt;/em&gt; and the late period novel &lt;em&gt;Milennium People&lt;/em&gt;) are sat in a row on top of my broken bookshelf, part of the weight there that bowed outer frame of the unit and made the inner shelves collapse. Had I known that it would be a task unfinished nearly eighteen months later and destroy a piece a furniture that I did not yet own, I may have been less ambitious.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In the end I realised it was Sophie Ellis-Bextor, though in parts she sounds like KT Tunstall too. Of course these are rather tame references and I don’t mean to damn with faint praise, this album is much more edgy than those two ever were. If you are after some girly power pop with a darker edge then this will no doubt be the album that you have been waiting for.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got into Début via a cassette from the library, much like I did with &lt;a href=&#34;uc1&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Together Alone&lt;/em&gt; by Crowded House&lt;/a&gt;. I suppose it is less obscure than many of my choices for &lt;a href=&#34;understated-classics&#34;&gt;this strand&lt;/a&gt; but I do think that &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; is more well-known (because of &lt;em&gt;It’s Oh So Quiet&lt;/em&gt;, which we shall mention here only briefly) and that &lt;em&gt;Homogenic&lt;/em&gt; is probably more popular among her fans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I really like about &lt;em&gt;Début&lt;/em&gt; though, as much as the album itself, is the panoply of remixes and alternative versions that surround the release. In this way &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; is at least as strong if not stronger and you might recall that I had similar fun &lt;a href=&#34;uc13&#34;&gt;when writing about the Orb’s album U.F.Orb a while back&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of this, there will be some detours into the remixes and live versions when discussing this album. In particular, I will mention the remix collection &lt;em&gt;the best mixes from the album début for all the people who don’t buy white labels&lt;/em&gt; and the recording of an MTV Unplugged show that is available in the &lt;em&gt;Live Box&lt;/em&gt; box set.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time there was a man who loved to paint. He studied the art and craft of painting for many years. He chose to invest his time and energy into creating the most realistic portraits that he could paint. For him the joy came not from completing the paintings but the process of recreating the real world with the strokes of his brush.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For many years he continued to study the art of painting. He learned new techniques for abstracting from reality but he always favoured the realism above all else. Meanwhile, his friends and family mocked him and said that he would always be a poor boy who loved to paint but could not make money from it. He had no answer to this criticism, the satisfaction he gained from applying the brush to the canvas was to great to worry about whether his paintings would be finished or not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dreams Of A Life&lt;/em&gt; is a documentary about Joyce Vincent, a woman who was found in her flat three years after her death surrounded by wrapped christmas presents and with the TV still on. £2400 in arrears on her rent, she was discovered by bailiffs who forced the door down. The film attempts to work out happened to Joyce by interviewing people who knew her. In two other strands that unfold in parallel, various events from her life are re-enacted along with the clearing of her flat by forensics officers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
