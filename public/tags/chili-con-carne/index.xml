      <description>I saw Betty Blue (original French title 37,2 Le Matin) for the first time in 1996 shortly after having read the book and it remains one of my favourite films to this day.

This post is a brief explanation of some of the obvious and not-so-obvious reasons why this is a film to be loved and cherished.</description>
