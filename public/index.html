                <p>I bought a Barbara Hepworth calendar in the sale at the Tate Modern shop that I thought was a steal until I realised it was a 2024 calendar, not a 2025 one! However, the joke&rsquo;s on them because I only have to wait until 2029 for the next year that starts with a Monday.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, unlike 2024, 2029 is <em>not</em> a leap year. This means all the days of the week would be wrong from March 1st onwards. It gets worse! The next two years that start on a Monday are 2035 and 2046, both of which quite obviously fail to be leap years.</p>
<p>Oh dear&hellip;</p>

                <h1><a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/peter-gabriel-so/" title="Peter Gabriel, So">Peter Gabriel, So</a></h1>
                <p>I recently watched the entry about Peter Gabriel&rsquo;s 1986 album &ldquo;So&rdquo; in the Classic Albums series on Amazon Prime. It was an entertaining way to fill an evening hour.</p>
<p>I absolutely love &ldquo;So&rdquo;. I came to its songs via the &ldquo;Secret World Live&rdquo; album, and it was &ldquo;Red Rain&rdquo; specifically that convinced me of his greatness. Previously, I&rsquo;d been aware of &ldquo;Sledgehammer&rdquo; (also on this album) and &ldquo;Steam&rdquo; (from the similarly titled &ldquo;Us&rdquo;), but &ldquo;Red Rain&rdquo; really captured my imagination.</p>

                <p>Writing a blog post every day is not essential. It&rsquo;s not part of some new year&rsquo;s resolution, despite the fact that the start of this unbroken streak of posts was January 1st. If anything my new year&rsquo;s resolution has been to try and step gently away from my perfection. And the adoption of that resolution began in the middle of 2024 rather than new year&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p>Around September time, I realised and began to recognise myself as I read many descriptions of crippling perfectionism, especially in how it relates to depression. Depression is a weird experience that is simultaneously subjective but also measurable in many ways. It became clearer and clearer to me that perfectionism was a significant component to my problems, in both work and the rest of life (i.e. the part that is most important). And so I began to try and undo a lifetime of thinking in a particular way, mostly guided by a set of rules that I now write down in all my notebooks. Those rules are for me, so I won&rsquo;t share them here, at least not today. But they are eminently findable on the internet and recognisable variations of common themes in self-help literature. I still need to work out which of them are genuine rules and which are merely guidelines.</p>
