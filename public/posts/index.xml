      <title>Some more thoughts on Civ 7</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been about 5 months now since the release of Civilisation VII and it&amp;rsquo;s starting to become a playable game. This is partly due to me getting used to it and partly the effect of quality of life patches and additional features.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing, one way to demonstrate the illusory nature of LLM intelligence is to get one to try and answer a cryptic crossword clue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>808 State, Don Solaris</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I sometimes wonder if I picked the correct 808 State album for my understated classics series. That&amp;rsquo;s because today I was listening to their 1996 album &lt;em&gt;Don Solaris&lt;/em&gt; and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty darn good. For understated classics I chose their earlier effort &lt;em&gt;Gorgeous&lt;/em&gt;, partly out of the belief that probably no one else ever would, but also because &lt;em&gt;10X10&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Plan 9&lt;/em&gt; are such total bangers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to settle on a text editor, IDE, and terminal for a long time now. Partly I&amp;rsquo;m limited by what I can use at work because I owe to myself and my colleagues to be able to reproduce all my skills in a work setting. However, part of me has also wandered off a bit after reading about the idea of a &amp;ldquo;personal Development Environment&amp;rdquo; (or PDE I guess, though in a former life that &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation&#34;&gt;meant something very different&lt;/a&gt;), which is essentially an application where you can do anything and have it configured exactly how you like. Here&amp;rsquo;s an update on my progress on that front:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of getting the garden done, we&amp;rsquo;ve been out and about looking for trees. It&amp;rsquo;s quite exciting seeing in person all the trees we&amp;rsquo;ve discussed with our garden designer. Here are some of the species we&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bill Drummond, 45</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;45&lt;/em&gt; is Bill Drummond&amp;rsquo;s sort of memoir, albeit one with a hazy memory of the events most readers (myself included) are likely to be interested in. Drummond is/was one half of pop-pranksters The KLF, but &lt;em&gt;45&lt;/em&gt; barely mentions them at all. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot about before (e.g. managing Echo and the Bunnymen in late-70s and early-80s Liverpool) and after (various shenanigans in the art world and attempting to relate to his children), some of that writing is very interesting. Nevertheless the whole lacuna of his pop heyday seems to punches a hole through the entire book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Wilco, A Ghost Is Born (Superdeluxe edition)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2022, I invested in the big superdeluxe box for Wilco&amp;rsquo;s most successful album &amp;ldquo;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&amp;rdquo;. Across 11 pieces of &amp;lsquo;silver&amp;rsquo; vinyl and one CD, the box set showed the tortuous process that Wilco went through to create that album. It&amp;rsquo;s a magnificent collection of music, though if you don&amp;rsquo;t like hearing multiple versions of the same song and are not fond of unfinished material, it&amp;rsquo;s not going to be as pleasant an afternoon as it is for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I pulled everything out of our shed and we took the stuff we didn&amp;rsquo;t need down to the dump. No one likes going to the dump, but it was strangely cathartic. It&amp;rsquo;s due in part to letting go of things from the past, but also the fact that I haven&amp;rsquo;t felt up to much lately. It ended up being a sunny afternoon so it was a pleasant walk back after we dropped off the hire car.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are some more stats about the blog after I ran out of time yesterday due to&#xA;data cleaning! This time I&amp;rsquo;ve taken the date of each post and extracted the&#xA;month and year. Then I added the number of posts in each month and the number of&#xA;words written. I had to left join on the complete time span between August 2010&#xA;and February 2025, filling in any NA values for the zeros that were missing&#xA;before I did that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are thinking about making your own blog, here are some links to help you on your way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a very simple introduction to making websites that Pixel Shannon wrote for her daughter to help her create a website for a class project. It&amp;rsquo;s not completely at a 12 year old&amp;rsquo;s level, so don&amp;rsquo;t be put off by that idea. She gives a very good introduction to what HTML is and what else you have to put in there to get a website up and running. There&amp;rsquo;s also a big list of resources that I won&amp;rsquo;t repeat here, so be sure to check those out too:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sid Meier&amp;rsquo;s Civilization VII is out today to much fanfare. After spending what top scientists are calling &amp;ldquo;far too long&amp;rdquo; playing Civ VI and a couple of run-throughs of the new game during the early access period, here are some thoughts on the new instalment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I bought a Barbara Hepworth calendar in the sale at the Tate Modern shop that I thought was a steal until I realised it was a 2024 calendar, not a 2025 one! However, the joke&amp;rsquo;s on them because I only have to wait until 2029 for the next year that starts with a Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, unlike 2024, 2029 is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a leap year. This means all the days of the week would be wrong from March 1st onwards. It gets worse! The next two years that start on a Monday are 2035 and 2046, both of which quite obviously fail to be leap years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oh dear&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently watched the entry about Peter Gabriel&amp;rsquo;s 1986 album &amp;ldquo;So&amp;rdquo; in the Classic Albums series on Amazon Prime. It was an entertaining way to fill an evening hour.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I absolutely love &amp;ldquo;So&amp;rdquo;. I came to its songs via the &amp;ldquo;Secret World Live&amp;rdquo; album, and it was &amp;ldquo;Red Rain&amp;rdquo; specifically that convinced me of his greatness. Previously, I&amp;rsquo;d been aware of &amp;ldquo;Sledgehammer&amp;rdquo; (also on this album) and &amp;ldquo;Steam&amp;rdquo; (from the similarly titled &amp;ldquo;Us&amp;rdquo;), but &amp;ldquo;Red Rain&amp;rdquo; really captured my imagination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing a blog post every day is not essential. It&amp;rsquo;s not part of some new year&amp;rsquo;s resolution, despite the fact that the start of this unbroken streak of posts was January 1st. If anything my new year&amp;rsquo;s resolution has been to try and step gently away from my perfection. And the adoption of that resolution began in the middle of 2024 rather than new year&amp;rsquo;s day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Around September time, I realised and began to recognise myself as I read many descriptions of crippling perfectionism, especially in how it relates to depression. Depression is a weird experience that is simultaneously subjective but also measurable in many ways. It became clearer and clearer to me that perfectionism was a significant component to my problems, in both work and the rest of life (i.e. the part that is most important). And so I began to try and undo a lifetime of thinking in a particular way, mostly guided by a set of rules that I now write down in all my notebooks. Those rules are for me, so I won&amp;rsquo;t share them here, at least not today. But they are eminently findable on the internet and recognisable variations of common themes in self-help literature. I still need to work out which of them are genuine rules and which are merely guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The problem with keeping up a blog streak for however many days it is now is that you don&amp;rsquo;t actually get a huge amount of time to think of ideas for posts and actually write them. Ironically, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about this post for a while though.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m not afraid of writing in them, it&amp;rsquo;s just that I&amp;rsquo;ve bought so many over the years I can&amp;rsquo;t get through them quick enough.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The release of Pomme Fritz by The Orb in 1994 was a moment of genuine excitement for me as it was the first new material they released after I&amp;rsquo;d become aware of them. Not only that, but thanks to my hard work riding around Emsworth on my BMX at unsafe speeds belting out Green Day&amp;rsquo;s Dookie as out-of-tune-ly as is humanly possible, I&amp;rsquo;d managed to secure the funds to buy the album for myself. My excitement had been mounting from the moment the promotional postcard arrived a few weeks beforehand. I took my £4.99 to Our Price in Portsmouth Cascades on Saturday afternoon and bought myself a copy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And boy, I pretty much hated it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recent explorations in R have reminded me about two ways of thinking about how you refer to objects or (parts of objects) in the language.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Slots are probably what you learn about first, they use the &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; syntax. In R, the &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; operator is used to access specific elements or columns within a data structure, such as a list, data frame, or environment. You can think of it as an ersatz shorthand for the &lt;code&gt;tidyverse::select()&lt;/code&gt; function, except that the latter is more powerful because you can do funky things like selecting multiple columns programmatically. By programmatically I mean &amp;ldquo;in some way that is not predetermined until you run your code&amp;rdquo;, e.g. because you are selecting a subset of columns of your data frame that didn&amp;rsquo;t exist until (long) before that step. Anyway, back to &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s a way of selecting a particular column of a data frame or any smaller part of an object in R. In fact, one of my main use cases for &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; used to be for recalculating columns in a data frame when I wasn&amp;rsquo;t confident about using &lt;code&gt;mutate()&lt;/code&gt;: changing a column to a factor with &lt;code&gt;mutate()&lt;/code&gt; gave me the heebie-jeebies for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having made it to one post per day in January, we now move into February: that graveyard of good habits for the new year. What is it about flipping over the calendar to a new month that does away with our resolve to continue with our resolutions? My office calendar has a lovely picture of a German steam train in the snow, in case you were wondering.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to reward myself at some point by allowing myself to fiddle with the blog&amp;rsquo;s theme a little more. Over the years, I&amp;rsquo;ve probably fiddled more with how the blog looks, rather than focussing on what to write. I&amp;rsquo;ve also turned on Hugo&amp;rsquo;s related posts module. The results are pretty high quality and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to affect the build time of the site. A custom version is still a pet project for the future though.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While off sick and under the weather I decided to play around with presenting the photos on this blog in a fashion more in keeping with the current Hugo theme.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://imagemagick.org&#34;&gt;Imagemagick&lt;/a&gt; to process the same files from &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/in-praise-of-paris/&#34;&gt;the Paris post&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week. I made them a bit smaller, reduced the number of colours to 256, posterized them (a built-in Imagemagick function that groups colours), and then did a dither on them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When making my albums of the year posts at the start of the month, I realised that compared to many other critics lists, there was no sign of &lt;em&gt;Brat&lt;/em&gt; by Charlie XCX. And when it came up again on my album shuffle the other day, I  thought I should re-evaluate the album and whether it should have made my list.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Listening to &lt;em&gt;Brat&lt;/em&gt; again for this post, it was clear that I&amp;rsquo;d missed out on something special. This was partly because I went for a walk with it on my headphones and that always lets me hear the details of the music. I think too many times when this album came on at home, it would be a little bit too doof-doof to be background music. These are songs that do demand (and deserve) a bit of attention.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dora Carrington was an artist loosely affiliated with the Bloomsbury Group and noted for her unconventional lifestyle. Despite a short career, her work had a great impact and &lt;a href=&#34;https://pallant.org.uk/whats-on/dora-carrington/&#34;&gt;a retrospective at the Pallant House Gallery in Chichester&lt;/a&gt; brings together some of her major works.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was a bit confused at the start of the show, as I had got my Carrington&amp;rsquo;s wrong! I&amp;rsquo;d been thinking this was a show about &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonora_Carrington&#34;&gt;Leonora Carrington&lt;/a&gt; who was active later, initially in circles with Max Ernst, and later on in her own right in Mexico City. I will have to wait for a retrospective of her work another time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thai Green Curry is one of our favourites. Often when we are travelling we will find a Thai restaurant and order it. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice way to see how a familiar dish is rendered in your new surroundings. More importantly, it&amp;rsquo;s a dish that&amp;rsquo;s reliably gluten and tomato free.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This time last year, Ingrid and I were on the Eurostar to Paris for four days. We did so much in our time there that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t write about it at the time. Here&amp;rsquo;s a little summary with a few photos.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our chief aim was to take in as much Rodin as possible (as he&amp;rsquo;s Ingrid&amp;rsquo;s favourite sculptor) so on the Saturday we set out for Montparnasse and struck out for Meudon, where his house is. And&amp;hellip; it was closed for winter!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I want to start making generative art again. I can&amp;rsquo;t say I ever did it that seriously but using programming languages to generate &amp;lsquo;art&amp;rsquo; is a pretty fun to while away the hours, especially when one&amp;rsquo;s talents for drawing truculently refuse to improve. Of course, more recently the phrase generative art might be said to have grown to encompass the GPT-class models that generate images from prompts. So what would be the point of coding something, when you can make &amp;lsquo;proper&amp;rsquo; art?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ian MacDonald&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Revolution in the Head&amp;rdquo; is a book that I&amp;rsquo;ve read parts of dozens of times and even all the way through once or twice. I picked it up again today and thought I would write about it. It&amp;rsquo;s a detailed analysis of every Beatles song ever released, along with the details and events of their recording. I own a copy of the second edition which was updated to include the anthology material. Today you can still get hold of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.waterstones.com/book/revolution-in-the-head/ian-macdonald/9780099526797&#34;&gt;a 3rd edition on the Waterstones website&lt;/a&gt; (not sure that I like the new cover though).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An album that arrived a bit too late to be considered in the best of the year list, &lt;em&gt;Strawberry Hotel&lt;/em&gt; by Underworld is a solid effort. Their 11th album, it remarks their return to the format after five years after the &lt;em&gt;Drift&lt;/em&gt; series in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drift&lt;/em&gt; had been an interesting experiment where Underworld had tried to put out a new track each week and grouping several weeks worth into EPs before putting out a massive 6+ hour box set. The striking thing about the project was that it was so good. They released a sampler edition of the album which cherry picked the best songs, but almost every track released as part of &lt;em&gt;Drift&lt;/em&gt; could be swapped into that sampler.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the absurd barriers to writing regularly is that my new post script is written to open the new markdown file in Neovim and until this week I had no idea how to type a hashtag (which markdown uses for headers) in this editor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Neovim, and its venerable predecessors vi and vim, is notorious for being a bit tricksy to work with. This is because it is a modal editor: you use keys to switch the editor between modes. The same key presses mean different things in different modes, which can be frustrating when you first start out and have no clue what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We had great success with our sticky toffee pudding as a Christmas Day dessert.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Around this time last year, I wrote in praise of writing a diary. I also rather misanthropically referred to it as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://mattischrome.com/posts/the-negativity-casket/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;negativity casket&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; because I found that I was pouring a lot of negative feelings into the notebook. It&amp;rsquo;s not really a diary as such because I don&amp;rsquo;t write everyday and I also make other non-diaristic notes, but it does appear to have been something of a process that has helped me to work through my negative feelings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Partly the problem of having a productive weekend of doing things rather than ruminating on blog topics. So unfortunately, we get another space-filling post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got lots of books on the go at the moment, including &amp;ldquo;Orbital&amp;rdquo; which won the Booker prize this year and &amp;ldquo;Otherlands&amp;rdquo; which is a really cool book about natural history going back in time through the eras of the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having recently completed my review of 2024&amp;rsquo;s best albums, I&amp;rsquo;ve been reflecting on what a strange year it was for me in terms of the music I listened to. According to my Last.fm annual report, I listened to 51% &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; music in 2024 compared with 2023 (and 2023 was itself a peak listening year). Moreover, I listened to 709 artists, of which 37% were new discoveries. I listened to over 2 albums a day apparently, with &lt;a href=&#34;https://mattischrome.com/posts/2024-albums-03-acopia/&#34;&gt;Acopia&lt;/a&gt; being the album I listened to most often. Apparently I was the 11th top listener on Last.fm of my number 1 album of the year &lt;a href=&#34;https://mattischrome.com/posts/2024-albums-01-bolis-pupul-letter-to-yu/&#34;&gt;Letter to Yu by Bolis Pupul&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the best pieces of advice I have ever been given about how to tackle programming problems is to treat your code as comments that describe your program to the computer, whilst the comments that are there for humans to read should tell them how the program is supposed to work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In recent days I have come to a realisation that you also need to try and see things as the computer sees them, rather than expecting it to see what you can see. I was working with some data that were formatted in a pretty way for humans and I was completely flummoxed because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of it into R. The more I stared at the files, the more I began to see all these weird anomalies like completely blank columns that had been shrunk to near zero widths and inconsistencies between files with how the main components of the data were stored. It&amp;rsquo;s been a strange experience!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Getting back to my occasional album revisits, I&amp;rsquo;d like to consider the 2021 Parquet Courts album &amp;ldquo;Sympathy For Life&amp;rdquo;. This is partly because I own it on vinyl and put it on the other day while I was doing some rather humdrum data downloading at work. It&amp;rsquo;s that kind of album, quite loose and jam-based.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In searching for something to write about today, I wondered whether I had ever written about Pilates on this blog before. I modified &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/fun-with-chatgpt/&#34;&gt;the search of my posts from yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post&lt;/a&gt; to look for the word Pilates&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and it only came up once in &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/ambitions-revisited/&#34;&gt;a post about revisiting my ambitions ten years on&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There I wrote:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I haven’t taken up meditation at all because the inside of my head is way too noisy. What I did do (at Ingrid’s suggestion) is take up Pilates: I swear by it now. It’s not quite the same as meditation but I’ve found the improvements to my core strength to be quite useful for my mental health.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In that folder are more folders that are named for the slug of each post, as per the conventions of the Hugo static site generator. Those folders each contain a markdown file named index.md, each of which has a YAML header. Draft posts have a YAML key called draft which has the value true. Please can you write me a shell script that I can run from the directory above posts that tells me which folders in the posts folder contain draft posts?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2025 might be a tough year, but I am going to try and blog every day. It means that now and then I might be writing a post like this one, where I am writing for the sake of continuing the streak. If I find myself doing that too often then I will take the hint and stop trying!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This weekend was the 3rd round of the FA Cup, which is when the premier league and championship teams enter the competition. This is the first time for quite a few years where Portsmouth have entered at this stage. Naturally, they&amp;rsquo;re already out! Mind you, in recent years when they&amp;rsquo;ve entered at the first round they haven&amp;rsquo;t made it past those rounds either. That was bad news for one pub in Portsmouth which always made a big show of not taking down their Christmas decorations until Pompey were out of the FA Cup!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bolispupul.bandcamp.com&#34;&gt;Bolis Pupul&lt;/a&gt; (the stage name of Boris Zeebroek) is an artist on &lt;a href=&#34;https://deew.ee/catalogue&#34;&gt;Soulwax&amp;rsquo;s Deewee label&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://deew.ee/catalogue/074&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Letter to Yu&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; is his debut album, inspired by a trip to Hong Kong to investigate his family history. It investigates themes of place, family, and identity. We are exposed to everywhere all at once but we&amp;rsquo;re also all &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; somewhere, even if it&amp;rsquo;s somewhere we might not recommend or understand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aside from the theme of the album, it&amp;rsquo;s a satisfying and varied electronic album. You have a pop song early on in &amp;ldquo;Completely Half&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;I thought that I / would fit right in / I&amp;rsquo;m on the border of the state I&amp;rsquo;m in&amp;rdquo;) but the rest of side one is fine electro, peaking with the frenetic &amp;ldquo;Doctor Says&amp;rdquo; and ebbing out with the ringing &amp;ldquo;Spicy Crab&amp;rdquo;. (I realised writing this that the vinyl omits &amp;ldquo;Frogs&amp;rdquo; from the streaming version, but this makes the vinyl version of the album better paced.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tiger&amp;rsquo;s Blood&amp;rdquo; is a glorious bundle of songs that writhe with brains and heart, with love and friendship, and many other complements and opposites. The music is mostly alternative AOR with a distinct country twang. The lyrics were pretty impenetrable to me, at least until I looked them up online (and they&amp;rsquo;re also on the back of the poster that came with the LP), but they&amp;rsquo;re mostly songs of hope and happiness. It was satisfying to listen to an album this care-free, even if there is a hint of darker times in the background.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Acopia are a band from Melbourne Australia with that time honoured line up of one girl and two guys. This eponymous album is their second and it&amp;rsquo;s full of slinky electronic ballads that echo classic 90s trip hop. It&amp;rsquo;s got that same downtempo downbeat vibe, the sorts of songs that revel in sadness but also the joy of a killer bass line.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This album was actually released in November 2023 but I first heard it in January 2024 after reading a glowing review of it. I can remember the first time listening to it, I took the train to see my parents in to hand over a present I&amp;rsquo;d bought for my nephew. (Fittingly, it&amp;rsquo;s his birthday today.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One album that&amp;rsquo;s lurking in the periphery of my &lt;a href=&#34;&#34;&gt;understated classics series&lt;/a&gt; is &amp;ldquo;Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe In You&amp;rdquo; by Big Thief. &amp;ldquo;Bright Future&amp;rdquo; is the latest solo album by Big Thief singer-songwriter Adrianne Lenker and it is just as good. Intimate and intricate, it draws the listener in as Adrianne sings live with a very small band. At times you can hear breaths drawn and the sound feels like a small space that you are cocooned in: this could be sound engineering (spatial audio would have us believe anything is possible) but it&amp;rsquo;s most likely equipment set up intelligently in a cosy studio.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s interesting that an album sung entirely in Italian ended up being one of my favourites of the year, but perhaps not surprising given well written and arranged these songs are. They&amp;rsquo;re just the right side of electro-pop but also with an air of sophistication.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t speak Italian but I do speak some romance languages, so I can sort of guess what the titles might mean. &amp;ldquo;La Notte&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;The Night&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Il Bucchi Neri&amp;rdquo; is &amp;ldquo;The Black Holes&amp;rdquo; (I&amp;rsquo;d thought it was the black mouths but I guess I was close!), and so on. As the for the lyrics, they&amp;rsquo;re catching enough for me to sing a phonetic version of them to myself on many occasions, though I&amp;rsquo;ve no idea what meaning I&amp;rsquo;ve been mangling!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What do you think of when you think of the colour blue? The sea? Perhaps the sky? Maybe it makes you think of blue stones like sapphires, or flowers such as forget-me-nots? Maybe the colour blue is the glow of a phone screen on someone&amp;rsquo;s face (maybe yours) in the dark? Blue gathers at the edges of the harsh white LED light that has come to dominate our night time existence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2024 Albums of the Year #7: MGMT, Loss Of Life</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know very much about MGMT these days. I haven&amp;rsquo;t read any interviews about their albums. The video to the single &amp;ldquo;Nothing to Declare&amp;rdquo; was brought to my attention by the YouTube channel Justin Hawkins Rides Again. In it he points out how melodically interesting the song is. To be honest I was more than a little bit in love with the video.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After that I added the album to my library and heard a few more singles in the run up to the release of the album, including &amp;ldquo;Bubblegum Dog&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Mother Nature&amp;rdquo;. The album itself is crammed with similarly interesting songs and has a circular structure, beginning with part 2 of the title track. I&amp;rsquo;d love to know what poem is being read or sampled or cut up on &amp;ldquo;Loss of Life, Pt. 2&amp;rdquo;. Other highlights include &amp;ldquo;Phradie&amp;rsquo;s Song&amp;rdquo; and a song called &amp;ldquo;Nothing Changes&amp;rdquo; which goes a bot bonkers in the second half, completely undermining the title of the song!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2024 Albums of the Year #8: Pet Shop Boys Nonetheless</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless is the fifteenth album by the Pet Shop Boys. As seems to be a common theme with this top 10 so far, it&amp;rsquo;s an album that initially underwhelmed me. Well, perhaps &amp;ldquo;underwhelmed&amp;rdquo; is a little unfair, it was more that it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to have much to it to distinguish it from their previous albums, and there have been some palpable duds in the previous fourteen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, this album is definitely a grower. As I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten to know some of the songs, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to appreciate the little details strewn throughout. For example, the lovely little rave riff that breaks into the bridge on &amp;ldquo;Loneliness&amp;rdquo;, something that turns a potentially stern song into something a lot more fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first time I listened to this album, I was still off work sick with Covid, but well enough to go out for a walk on what was too hot a day to stay inside the house. I remember it well, recovering from illness does tend to make these things more vivid, but more because I thought it was brilliant, but all out of order. I was, of course, completely wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2024 Albums of the Year #10: Yard Act, Where&#39;s My Utopia?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yard Act are a post-punk band from Leeds. &amp;ldquo;Where&amp;rsquo;s My Utopia?&amp;rdquo; is their second album. I first encountered Yard Act in a review of this album, which sent me to look at the excellent video to their non-album single &amp;ldquo;The Trenchcoat Museum&amp;rdquo;. I enjoyed the metatextual references both in the video and the song, so I eagerly added &amp;ldquo;Where&amp;rsquo;s My Utopia?&amp;rdquo; to my library.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the album took a while to win me over. Fourth-wall breaking asides and meta references are fine in a single song, even one as long as &amp;ldquo;The Trenchcoat Museum&amp;rdquo;, but combined over the length of a whole album, it can be a bit off-putting. Nevertheless, WMU? rewards repeat listens (especially on headphones) because it&amp;rsquo;s genuinely funny - I think comedy is an underrated quality in Indie music - and the songs themselves are ace.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

With the help of this &lt;a href=&#34;https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/how-to-get-a-tags-page/24213/4&#34;&gt;very useful discourse thread&lt;/a&gt; and some additional CSS tweaks, the resulting page is something that I am very happy with. It lists all of the tags that apply to any post, along with the number of posts with that tag, in alphabetical order. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly intended as a guide for you the reader, to help you see whether your preoccupations match my own.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A hardback book called &amp;ldquo;The Satsuma Complex&amp;rdquo; is all that remains of a mysterious young lady that young lawyer Gary is chatting up in the pub one night. It&amp;rsquo;s a book that everyone reckons is &amp;ldquo;a bit sh*t&amp;rdquo;. But Gary&amp;rsquo;s moping about after the Satsuma lady doing a runner while he was in the loo will have to be put on hold when his friend turns up dead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed this book. It&amp;rsquo;s not going to win any prizes for quality of writing but it is both fun and funny. There are a few repetitive phrases and at one point beers magically become lagers in the space of three paragraphs. The writing is very colloquial but there is a point-of-view shift at the start of part two that deploys some writerly skill. (This short-lived though as the new point-of-view soon collapses down into one similar to the main character.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the new look for my blog. I&amp;rsquo;ve had my eye on a more minimal look for a while now. Whether this new look is successful or not depends on how often I write new posts. To that end, this theme also supports a separate (or almost separate) stream of photos. Once I&amp;rsquo;ve got back in to the habit of putting photos up, that should be a nice additional stream of content.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, a cat named Nerys ripped into the bottom of our sofa to make herself a cozy burrow. This was all well and good, except for the times when she would do it when we were using the sofa too. On these occasions (and presumably on most others) she would proceed to sharpen her claws on what remained of the fabric. (A less charitable reason for this behaviour would be that she was simply widening the whole for her future self after eating more and more kibbles!)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things that people tend to start around this time of year is a diary. They usually get filled for as long as your new year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions last.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing in my current diary for a while. It&amp;rsquo;s a Moleskine extra large ruled Notebook in beautiful Prussian Blue, covered in whatever stickers pass over my desk. (Hint: find my address and send me stickers Internet.) This is much more preferable to a &amp;lsquo;real&amp;rsquo; diary because I can leave a few days and then resume. I can also take breaks and write out a bunch of notes on Org-mode or the Julia programming language if I want to (and yes, I did).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I also read &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/where-have-all-the-websites-gone/&#34;&gt;this slightly more personal take by Jason Velasquez&lt;/a&gt;, which is more about how social networks have gobbled up all the time and attention of people who might otherwise be making interesting web sites. This has made me think deeply about what this blog is &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt;, and why I might continue to blog in Twenty Twenty Four.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Well dear reader I managed to! It arrived today from the Netherlands with minimal fuss. It sounds great and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure whether my review did it justice: that&amp;rsquo;s the problem with attempting to (re-)review ten albums in ten days with Christmas and New Year all happening at the same time!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Future Matt,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Always look up instructions for what you want to do in the Git documentation. It&amp;rsquo;s dry but it&amp;rsquo;s good. In a pinch, look at Stack Overflow. Don&amp;rsquo;t ask Chat-GPT for advice on Git problems!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;To reverse mistakes, consult the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohshitgit.com&#34;&gt;Oh Shit Git&lt;/a&gt; website.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;To make things easier, delete the remote to your Github repository and then add it (the remote) back again. This is so much easier than the alternative.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Best wishes,&#xA;Past Matt (with his annual flash of January git confidence).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sofia Kourtesis is a Berlin-based Peruvian dance producer, &amp;ldquo;Madres&amp;rdquo; is her debut album which follows on from a 2021 EP &amp;ldquo;Fresia Magdalena&amp;rdquo;. It was trailed by several singles, including the title track which caught my attention back in May. The album is dedicated to her parents and there are also songs dedicated to the surgeon who performed life-saving surgery on Kourtesis’s mother. The whole album is a heady mix of positivity and dedication to both music and to family.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some albums you come to one way: a good review on a blog you respect, a track appearing on a playlist by someone whose taste you trust, etc and so on. And sometimes you get directed to something multiple times. This is what happened to me this year with the irrepressible “When Will We Land?” by Barry Can’t Swim. Anyway, tracks by &amp;ldquo;Barry&amp;rdquo; appeared in mixes a lot this year and the album kept popping up in eagerly anticipated lists.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s probably no surprise that as we reach the top four (or five if you like) we also get to the two albums The National released in 2023. The first, “First Two Pages of Frankenstein”, was trailed with a big reveal early on in the year, while the second, “Laugh Track”, was dropped all of a sudden in October. Once I got to know both albums, I swung between liking each one more for a while, hence putting them both at the same point in the list and not considering each separately.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It would be remiss of me to claim that this is a placeholder for any number of (quite different sounding) song based albums that came out this year (Yves Tumor, Wilco to mention two) but it feels that way. This album came high up my list of listens because it&amp;rsquo;s a very good breakfast album, one to listen to while getting the Day started - though there are also some bangers on here too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Grails are one of those bands who always get played a lot at my house. There&amp;rsquo;s something about their slow incremental instrumental pieces that my brain just loves to get lost in. Anches en Maat, their first album in six years or so, and the first with the entire band in the studio together since 2008, is their most Grails-y album in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;rsquo;t a great deal I can write about The Ancient Truth without sounding vague and anodyne. While I try to come think about different forms of music and go into some analysis of what makes one album more interesting than another, sometimes you end up just saying &amp;ldquo;this album is great because I like it and I always have a good time listening to it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As you get older nostalgia becomes an ever important part of listening to music. It often feels like the business relies on convincing an aging population of fans to part with their money on new versions of old material. It&amp;rsquo;s nostalgia, the feeling of recapturing something you loved in your youth, that often makes this acceptable. Of course it&amp;rsquo;s also nice to get &lt;strong&gt;new&lt;/strong&gt; music from your favourite bands, especially when it&amp;rsquo;s as good as &amp;ldquo;Fuse&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Radical Romantics, the third album by Fever Ray was released in April. I bought a copy on red vinyl which is a beautiful sight to behold. I listened to a lot when it was released but eased up a bit until listening to it a couple more times while writing this list. It&amp;rsquo;s a great collection of songs, probably better than their second album &amp;ldquo;Plunge&amp;rdquo;. The cover art is just as scary though.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2023 Albums of the Year #10: Wata Igarashi, Agartha</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Agartha is the debut album by Japanese electronic artist Wata Igarashi. I don&amp;rsquo;t really know much about him, but I do know that I enjoy releases on the German record label Kompakt and I have really enjoyed Japanese techno in recent years. Over lockdown I discovered Haruomi Hosono&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Polyharmony&amp;rdquo; album and re-discovered the work of Shinichi Atobe, particularly their album &amp;ldquo;Love of Plastic&amp;rdquo;. Both of those albums could be future understated classics and while both are by Japanese artists working in electronic music, there the comparison ends.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2023 Albums of the Year Preview</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/albums-of-the-year-preview/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another year (nearly) over and so starting from tomorrow, I&amp;rsquo;m going to count down my top 10 albums of 2023. The rules are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They have to have to have been released in 2023.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They need to be albums. I&amp;rsquo;m defining this as either more than 7 tracks or songs, or more than forty minutes in length.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;To make the top ten, they need to have been played the most times. I admit that I don&amp;rsquo;t have a precise measure of this, as I do still buy vinyl and about four of these albums will have had play counts missed by not being captured through a streaming service.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Compilations are not included, whether they feature multiple artists or a retrospective of a single artist.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s pretty much it. Have I done any prep work? Well no, not really. I made a preliminary list at the start of October and not only was the number one album not out at the time (!) but I also had mistakenly included two albums from 2022. So yeah, this is not a pro operation. 😂&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Civ Leaders #4: Qin Shi Huang (Mandate of Heaven) of China</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, it&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I wrote &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/civ-leaders-3-amanitore-of-nubia&#34;&gt;my last Civ VI leader post about Amanitore of Nubia&lt;/a&gt; and there&amp;rsquo;s been a whole host of new leaders and personas added to the game since then. Among these the number of Chinese leaders has increased from two to five. Therefore it&amp;rsquo;s probably a good time to start writing about one of them, and where better to start than the OG himself, Qin Shi Huang. The recent leader pass has created a new persona for him but today we shall focus on his original version, which is now referred to in-game as his &amp;ldquo;Mandate of Heaven&amp;rdquo; persona.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It strikes me that it is better to sit and think about what you need to do, rather than endless try out new tools and hoping you end up with a use for them. I&amp;rsquo;m not saying that innovation is bad, or that you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t stretch yourself into some new spot once in a while, but you will become more valuable to others if you can identify what it is you are supposed to be doing and then use your existing skills to get that job done. Don&amp;rsquo;t go looking at galleries of tools and techniques in service of finding something to do. Trust me, I know from experience that it is a great way to spend a hell of a lot of time not getting anywhere in particular.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ellie Goulding - Bright Lights</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So today &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/how-random-should-things-be/&#34;&gt;my random album script&lt;/a&gt; picked out &amp;ldquo;Bright Lights&amp;rdquo; by Ellie Goulding, an album I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure I&amp;rsquo;ve ever listened to. I looked in my music library and there it was! As a result this is not so much an &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/tag/album%20revisit/&#34;&gt;album revisit&lt;/a&gt; as an album _&lt;em&gt;visit&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this album was released in 2010 and did quite well. In fact, &amp;ldquo;Bright Lights&amp;rdquo; is a reissue of an album that was originally released as &amp;ldquo;Lights&amp;rdquo; (February 2010). This version adds seven extra tracks, which explains why it&amp;rsquo;s an exhausting seventeen tracks long. &amp;ldquo;Lights&amp;rdquo; was a successful debut and a few of the singles went top 20, which is what led to its re-release with all those extra songs in November of the same year. (I think this is why it is in my collection, I think I bought it for my mum or for a sibling as part of a Christmas present, and ripped the CD out of curiosity&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hot Chocolate Comparison</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a massive fan of hot chocolate. Recently a friend recommended M&amp;amp;S hot chocolate flakes. Thanks to a promotion it was about half the price of the Montezuma&amp;rsquo;s hot chocolate discs that we usually buy. The Montezuma&amp;rsquo;s ones are lush (that&amp;rsquo;s official hot chocolate tasting terminology) but in this economy anything that saves a bit of money has got to be good right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, there are other things to consider. For one, what&amp;rsquo;s the cost per drink? After reading the instructions for the M&amp;amp;S hot chocolate, it was clear that it might not make as many drinks as the Montezuma&amp;rsquo;s hot chocolate does.  That said, we prefer to use one disc rather than the suggested two,  and sure enough, we also found that we only needed about half the hot chocolate when using the M&amp;amp;S flakes too. Nevertheless you still get 66% more drinks from the Montezuma&amp;rsquo;s hot chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is one of my more played Fabric mix CDs so I decided to go for it when my random prompter plumped for this earlier today. One constraint of these posts was to write it in roughly the amount of time it takes to listen to it. You&amp;rsquo;d think that for a mix CD that would be ok. After all, this mix is a full CD and 74 minutes long.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to extract my music library, including all the albums I&amp;rsquo;ve added to streaming, as a CSV file and write a routine in R to select an album at random. The plan is to write about that album for the blog in roughly the time that it takes to listen to that album all the way through. I already did this yesterday for &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/goldfrapp-black-cherry&#34;&gt;Goldfrapp&amp;rsquo;s Black Cherry.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I have to level with you. That was not the first album that was picked. Nor is the album selection process entirely unbiased. I got to a working situation and stopped there. Essentially, I smoosh together artist and album title, so that albums like compilations, or albums where the lead artist collaborates with multiple other artists, are slightly over-represented. I say slightly as the pool was already pretty large with just unique albums. I might do what I did yesterday and ignore singles or compilations, especially as the code takes almost zero time to give me another idea.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Goldfrapp - Black Cherry</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the first in an unplanned series of &lt;strong&gt;album revisits&lt;/strong&gt;, I will write a post explaining the process soon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Cherry_(Goldfrapp_album)&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Black Cherry&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; is the second album by Goldfrapp, released in 2003. I bought the lead single Train while I lived in York and also the single of the title track because by then I&amp;rsquo;d discovered M83 and they&amp;rsquo;d done a remix of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Black Cherry&amp;rdquo; finds the band faced with following their successful and chilled out debut album &amp;ldquo;Felt Mountain&amp;rdquo;, which back in 2000 had sounded notably weird. But nobody wants to sound like a kook forever, sometimes people want to let their hair down and just dance. That&amp;rsquo;s very much what the first two tracks anyway, especially the pulsating &amp;ldquo;Train&amp;rdquo;. To my ears, I was definitely pleased when I first played the single - I love that relentless synth riff that sounds like it&amp;rsquo;s being fed through about seventy FX pedals. I vaguely remember the single&amp;rsquo;s B-side &amp;ldquo;Big Black Cloud, Little White Lie&amp;rdquo; and the Village Hall Remix being pretty ace too. Fortunately they&amp;rsquo;re also on streaming, so I was able to check. I think I liked the B-side because it sounded very much like a &amp;ldquo;Felt Mountain&amp;rdquo; outtake - twenty years ago I likely appreciated the familiarity but today it serves a reminder that while &amp;ldquo;Felt Mountain 2&amp;rdquo; would have been nice, &amp;ldquo;Black Cherry&amp;rdquo; definitely benefitted from changing things up a bit. The Remix is mostly instrumental and adds even more Glitter beat stomp to Train, pleasant enough I guess.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;White rabbits and all that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even more than during the pandemic, I&amp;rsquo;m feeling these days like the days, weeks, and months are all blurring into one another. It&amp;rsquo;s getting harder to figure out what year something happened, how the old the cats are, and just how overdue all my promises are. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely getting harder to look at this blog and wonder whether it will ever get back to its heyday of regularly posted updates. It&amp;rsquo;s possible that the continued erosion of various social media sites might make blogs useful, useable, and used again, though popularity of a medium is no guarantee that I will actually use it!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I gave up writing reviews of movies because:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I never felt I got the balance right between describing the plot and why I liked the film.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t watch enough movies to be able to draw comparisons that are interesting, just between the small subset of total films that I have watched.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know enough about film making to properly describe why a movie made me feel a particular way and how to discuss the different possibilities available to the director, the actors, and the other artists involved with creating a movie.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But of course, every now and then you see a movie and think &amp;ldquo;wow! I need to tell people about this&amp;rdquo;. And for me that recent film was &amp;ldquo;Decision To Leave&amp;rdquo;, a Korean film that was released last year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A set of rules for living from now on (in no particular order)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Life is too short to look at adverts. Avoid them where possible. Block them if you have to.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Embrace risk and chance, as they have contributed the most to where you are now.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Intervene into physical things and leave your mark upon them. Draw pictures on the blank pages of books, even if they are dear to you. Fill your notebooks &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; buying yourself new ones. Insert name tags in your clothes.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Every day should be an attempt to see new things, and out of things, people like most to be seen.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;As good as it is to solve puzzles, try and avoid the rut of constantly solving the same puzzle lest it no longer require any mastery.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Learn the 13 times table. (This is where I need to start, then I will move up to 17 and on up through the prime numbers.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Have a business card. Try to cram in as much information on both sides.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Write write write. I will not be happy until I put some sort of rubbish on my blog &lt;strong&gt;every day&lt;/strong&gt;. Actually I could be writing three blogs but I need to get better at writing one first.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Write out lists of quotes that inspire you in a notebook. Give those notebooks out as gifts. It’s not like anyone will read the quotes, much less take them to heart. But at least they’ll have a sampler for decoding your written notes after you shuffle off the mortal coil.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you have reached the age of forty three and don’t know how to knit, fucking well learn to knit a scarf. Of course, this does not apply to learning to drive, which is a violent and dangerous activity.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ask people about their tattoos and indulge your curiosity about how much they/it might have hurt.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The reason for drawing terrible sketches, writing awful jokes and getting absolutely nowhere with the garden is simply to enjoy that process of being shit at things and making mistakes. Show people the bad stuff as well as the good stuff.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Even at the middle of your life, there aren’t that many lunches left. You might want to alternate between what you like and what you’re curious about. (I freely admit that at the moment I am a terrible stick in the mud when it comes to my very conventional lunches.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Try to establish the clothes you most feel like yourself in (presumably these are also comfortable) and always wear those.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Touch typing is a skill that is surprisingly enjoyable to practice. It’s like getting your left and right brains together to plan a heist (while they argue over who gets the G and the Y)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Eat slowly, savour the flavours. Unless you are a guest and your host has expressed anxiety about the success of their culinary adventure, in that case you should savour or galumph it down as politeness dictates.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When you’re asking someone if they need a bit of help, remember that some people need more cajoling than others. Remember also that some people won’t feel comfortable accepting help no matter how you press; sometimes you have to come back to it later.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Adopt a new pose for every photo people take of you. Give the facial recognition overlords something to work with.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think there&amp;rsquo;s a sense of safety when putting energy into something that&amp;rsquo;s latent and/or hidden as it immediately makes it low stakes. Other more open routes to success contain fear of failure, but also a fear of going after something that won&amp;rsquo;t give you the same buzz or edge. There&amp;rsquo;s a thrill seeking element but it&amp;rsquo;s also about containing and confining it to a success zone. Keeping this success zone private also means that there&amp;rsquo;s no risk that someone might try and take it away from you. There&amp;rsquo;s so much risk in putting any kind of desire or chance for failure out into the public domain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As with most years, I had hoped to start off 2023 with a flurry of new blog posts. Instead I caught Covid, which knocked me out for most of &amp;lsquo;betweenmas&amp;rsquo; and put paid to my hopes for a productive start to the year. At the time of writing this post, I only just feel like I have begun to get back to &amp;rsquo;normal&amp;rsquo;, or at least as normal as things have been since 2020.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Went with my friend Nick to see The Orb at Concord 2 last night. The last time I&amp;rsquo;d seen the Orb was back in 2004, at the start of their relatively dry spell. That night, they&amp;rsquo;d been a bit lacklustre despite playing (some of) the hits and a relatively decent album in &amp;ldquo;Bicycles and Tricycles&amp;rdquo;. I left feeling that I&amp;rsquo;d seen the past rather than the future, something that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t glimpse again in their records until 2015.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ingrid and I joined our usual quiz team tonight for the residents&amp;rsquo; association pub quiz. As usual we came third. It&amp;rsquo;s a fairly settled group of attendees and we know our level. We&amp;rsquo;re also quite used to the quiz master and his questions, though I do wish he&amp;rsquo;d acknowledge that pop music continued to be a thing long after the sixties!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s always a pot luck round. On one round we get to play a joker which doubles your points. I normally joke that we should play our joker on pot luck. The idea of countering the randomness of the round by getting double points appeals to me. I think we got a full house on pot luck this month, but we had not played our joker! (EDIT: I&amp;rsquo;m informed by Ingrid that we actually got 20/20 on a food and drink round called &amp;lsquo;Five a day&amp;rsquo;.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I began writing this post after realising that it is the first of June and I might as well attempt once more to write a post every day. The speed with which the first of the month comes around, inviting another such promise, always amuses me. But at the moment I am not sure whether this blog will still exist come the end of the month. I think I want to start again in pastures new.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since moving to an M1 Mac, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed some issues with my second screen that I do not experience with my previous Intel Mac or with my current work laptop, which is a Dell Intel PC running Windows 10.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I get a lot of flickering on the screen, which is intolerable if I have Pro-motion and True Tone turned on. Note that these are options for the main display rather than the external monitor. I think this means that Apple does not or cannot let you apply these settings granularly, they have to be on or off system-wide.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rosewater is an exciting science fiction novel set several decades after first contact with an alien called Wormwood, that has established itself as a large biodome in Nigeria. The novel follows Kaaro, a thief whose extra special abilities are forged from an unlikely connection with the alien. The whole thing is part sci-fi adventure and part spy novel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The novel is set in multiple timelines with whole sections of the story told in flashback. This gives a sense of hopping through Kaaro’s memories and helps us explore this strange futuristic vision of Nigeria. It also really helps with pace, first by throwing us into the story and then helping to explain the relationships between the characters we are introduced to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I find it hard to get started on projects. This may have always been the case. I definitely remember instances of complex plans for school projects that I&amp;rsquo;d barely have time to finish. I once got up at 6AM to finish making a calendar in French—I thought it was going to be this outstanding piece of work that would genuinely replace my teacher&amp;rsquo;s calendar! Reality didn&amp;rsquo;t quite match the idea though.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Imaginary Girlfriend&lt;/em&gt; is a short autobiography by American author John Irving. In it, he explains the interwoven roles of writing and wrestling in his life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As always with Irving, the book is absorbing from the off, and it&amp;rsquo;s tempting to use the anecdotes here to explain why most of his novels seem to have an underdog narrating them. It&amp;rsquo;s because he loves the work of Dickens so much. I kid. It might be because it is a role he has created for himself, and maybe he likes to write what he knows.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Civilisations&amp;rsquo; is a counterfactual historical novel that attempts to extrapolate the future course of history after changing one pivotal moment of the timeline. I usually find novels like this are great fun, another entertaining example is &amp;lsquo;Making History&amp;rsquo; by Stephen Fry. The novel, originally written in French, won some big awards in France last year. I read the translation by Sam Taylor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In &amp;lsquo;Civilisations&amp;rsquo;, Binet makes the pivotal point of his tale, the migration of Erik the Red to America in the late 900s. The idea of the novel is that as the vikings move down the coast of north and Central America, they bring exposure to (and therefore some eventual immunity from) smallpox and the ability to work with iron. This equips and prepares the indigenous people ahead of Christopher Columbus&amp;rsquo; arrival in 1492.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>TIL: footnotes in Latex captions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I had an interesting bug in some Latex code I am writing. Putting a footnote into a caption caused the document to fail compilation. The problem was that this document doesn&amp;rsquo;t use a table of figures at the start, so I hadn&amp;rsquo;t thought to include a short summary caption. Apparently the curly brace in the footnote command does not sit well with that, even if you aren&amp;rsquo;t using a list or table of figures in your document. The solution is simple, as long as the footnote isn&amp;rsquo;t crucial to the list of tables!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, we transferred our Christmas tree to a new pot. Being root-bound as the tree was, it took ages to get it out of the crappy pot from the store and into the new, bigger pot. And I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure it&amp;rsquo;s a bit wonky, which might make the baubles a bit lopsided next Christmas. It looks excellent next to the new bird bath.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, it was nice to get another plant into a pot with the hope of keeping it around. Currently, our garden is mostly bulbs erupting from pots. We covered what used to be the lawn in plastic sheeting last December to kill off the grass (and more importantly, the weeds). We had a look underneath it all last weekend, and it&amp;rsquo;s doing the job. It should be possible to continue the next phase of redoing the garden in March (depending on the weather). But it does mean that plant life is currently pot-bound, except for the shed-hugging Jasmine that Ingrid brought back to life a couple of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifeforms&lt;/strong&gt; is the 1994 album from the Future Sound of London. A double album (just), it also features the talents of Robert Fripp, Ozric Tentacles, Talvin Singh, Toni Halliday, and Liz Frazer. It reached number 6 on the UK album chart and went silver.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have wanted to write about the &lt;strong&gt;Lifeforms&lt;/strong&gt; album for a long time. In 2012, I even tried learning how to tell the tracks apart from one another. It was not a success. Ten years later, I know some of them but not all. I know all the music, of course, but the album as a whole resists my trainspotter-like urge to identify the margins and components of every track.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the moment I can’t compile this blog locally because my &lt;code&gt;ruby-ffi&lt;/code&gt; install is somehow wrong and is preventing Jekyll from running on my recently upgraded Mac system. Fortunately the site still compiles on Netlify, or else you wouldn’t be reading this!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s always annoying when you rely on a complex multi-part system and some obscure part fails. It leaves you groping for answers and inventing unnecessary hack solutions. The dreaded old Stack Overflow rabbit hole. FFI stands for &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface&#34;&gt;Foreign Function Interface&lt;/a&gt;, a mechanism that allows code written in one language to be called by another language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hmmm it seems as though the &lt;code&gt;ffi&lt;/code&gt; gem as installed by bundler is not compatible with a Mac that has an M1 chip. This limits my ability to preview blog posts locally. I might have to swap to a more modern static site generator (which is probably easier than working out what &lt;code&gt;ffi&lt;/code&gt; actually does) - seems like a good February project!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the new year, thoughts and spare time for writing point me toward writing some new posts for my understated classics series. Expect some new ones soon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also reflected on my previous choices and thought a bit about how my music tastes have changed recently. Some of this has to do with streaming and the frustrations I wrote about &lt;a href=&#34;https://mattischrome.com/a-pox-on-both-their-houses&#34;&gt;in my last post&lt;/a&gt;. Some of it is just down to getting older: I have less time to listen to new music, and much of the &amp;rsquo;new&amp;rsquo; stuff I listen to is me investigating the stuff I missed first time around. Who knew Art of Noise were so good? Not me, but I do now!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How hard is it to just listen to music these days?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Spotify has crammed in all sorts of crap in to the app lately. Lyric videos, those weird interactive art things that are turned on by default, podcasts (so many podcasts), &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22798338/spotify-netflix-hub-exclusive-audio-extras&#34;&gt;Netflix tie-ins&lt;/a&gt;, and audiobooks. It wants to be the app that opens when you plug in your headphones (not that we’ll be doing that for much longer the way things are going). But I just want to listen to music!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I listened to &amp;lsquo;Cloudbusting&amp;rsquo; by Kate Bush for the first time in a while. What a gloriously strange song it is. Best of all, it&amp;rsquo;s one of those songs that obscures what it is really about. It&amp;rsquo;s not a song about a change in the weather, but about &lt;a href=&#34;https://wilhelmreichmuseum.org/about/biography-of-wilhelm-reich/&#34;&gt;Wilhelm Reich&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orgone&#34;&gt;orgone&lt;/a&gt; accumulator, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cultofweird.com/medical/radium-girls/&#34;&gt;fluorescent yo-yos&lt;/a&gt;, and a son (rather than a &lt;em&gt;sun&lt;/em&gt;) coming out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Cloudbusting&amp;rsquo; is from &amp;lsquo;Hounds of Love&amp;rsquo;, Kate&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;comeback&amp;rsquo; album following the commercial failure of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mattischrome.com/understated-classics-19&#34;&gt;&amp;lsquo;The Dreaming&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt;, an album I wrote about in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://mattischrome.com/tag/understated%20classics/&#34;&gt;understated classics series&lt;/a&gt;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was due to have my second vaccination today, but like most people I rebooked to have it a bit earlier. No real side effects this time, save for a bit of malaise. Though that may have just been the thought of opening up the country when cases are still increasing quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It goes without saying that I&amp;rsquo;d urge everyone to get vaccinated and then to keep turning up for whatever boosters the people protecting us (e.g. JCVI, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the government) recommend in future. It seems like we aren&amp;rsquo;t out of the woods yet, though the vaccination program appears to have had a decent impact on hospitalisation rates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Outline&lt;/em&gt; is the first of a trilogy of novels by Rachel Cusk. In it, the narrator is travelling to Athens to help teach on a creative writing class. You could describe the rest of what happens in a couple of sentences. I won&amp;rsquo;t be doing so because first, that&amp;rsquo;s spoilers, and I don&amp;rsquo;t do spoilers; second, &lt;em&gt;Outline&lt;/em&gt; is one of those novels where what happens doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter quite so much as how it all happens.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know about you, but lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been in need of some music that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Blots out the outside world&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Helps me to concentrate on my work&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Makes me feel a bit less anxious about the state of the world&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, allow me to submit the compilation Trance Nation for your consideration as an understated classic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But Matt I&amp;rsquo;ve heard trance music, I hear you say, and it&amp;rsquo;s one of the least understated forms of music possible. Yes, dear reader, we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; talking about that borderline obnoxious musical form with the thudding beats and the tinkly high synth lines. Indeed, it is a genre that has grown and eaten itself, and the rest of pop music along with it. The &amp;ldquo;give it a drop or go home&amp;rdquo; mentality that infects modern pop musics originates in Trance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had my first Covid-19 vaccination on Friday. Leading up to it, I was borderline having a panic attack. From about lunchtime I was just all over the shop (the jab was at 7pm). I&amp;rsquo;m glad that the vaccination centres run with such exactitude, but also with a sense of cheeriness. By the time I&amp;rsquo;d had the jab, I was feeling much better just from the sheer relief of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m also learning by doing, by making a line on the page. In some ways, it&amp;rsquo;s instructive to observe the difference in what we learn with and without the feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We bought some drawing materials and nice notepads. But to be honest, I still haven&amp;rsquo;t made room in my day to draw regularly. This is a shame because you do have do these things regularly in order to develop the skill.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In the autumn, everything took a desolate cast, the colors swiftly fading before my eyes. The sunlight, the smell of the grass, the faintest patter of rain, everything got on my nerves.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing this post came about from  frustration with blogging. Specifically the tools I am using. Often it feels like a new language or paradigm comes along that shifts one or two of the pain points of blogging. The biggest are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;How long it takes to get a post on the internet once you’ve written it&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The reliability of the resulting website&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;How good the resulting website looks&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that none of this really impacts the quality of the writing. I’m not claiming to be a good writer: in fact I spend so much time blogging or thinking about blogging because it is my writing practice. (I think I am getting better, but slowly).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This Is How You Lose the Time War is a short novella about two members of opposing factions (Red and Blue) engaged in a &amp;rsquo;time war’: that is they travel in time and attempt to erase each other&amp;rsquo;s existence. Except that one day Red decides to taunt Blue with a letter, and a correspondence emerges.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The book is entertaining by virtue of wit and brevity. However, the elements that are skipped over that end up being more interesting to reflect on later. Clearly these are two talented writers bouncing ideas off one another, but you get a  sense that this whole fictional universe might have developed into something more. I was more interested in individual episodes than in the correspondence and its results. Perhaps the writers have ended up constrained by their witty idea.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Italo Calvino, If on a Winter&#39;s Night a Traveller</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last year I started to write a review of Italo Calvino&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;If on a Winter&amp;rsquo;s Night a Traveller&amp;rdquo;. I read it while we were in Germany for Christmas. We&amp;rsquo;d visited Bremen and also undergone the bizarreness of Christmas in another language - the same motifs played out in different words and different customs. I&amp;rsquo;d tried to write the review in a similar structure to the book but, in a testament to Calvino&amp;rsquo;s writing I couldn&amp;rsquo;t pull it off. Here&amp;rsquo;s the opening paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The mind may give up its desire to improve on creation and function as a faithful receiver of experience.&amp;rdquo; John Cage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After enjoying &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/the-overstory/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Overstory&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted to read more of Richard Powers&amp;rsquo; novels. &lt;em&gt;Orfeo&lt;/em&gt;  was also long listed for the Booker prize. Perhaps more of his novels would have been had the prize been opened to American authors earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Orfeo&lt;/em&gt; is about Peter Els, a seventy year old composer who accidentally alerts Homeland Security to the existence of his home laboratory, in which he has been trying to recode the genetic material of a bacterium to include a piece of his music. He ends up on the run, which provides the catalyst for a narrative in which we ponders the past and returns to it. Woven throughout is a history of contemporary classical music, most real and some invented.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve listened to music in slightly different ways to normal in the last nine months, but it’s still been a decent year for music. When I checked out my Spotify Unwrapped and my Last.fm reports, I had listened to more 2020 music than I thought.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve had cause to dig out some old photos. If I&amp;rsquo;m honest it&amp;rsquo;s made me sad. Sadder than I was expecting. There&amp;rsquo;s a quote from Nan Goldin that once felt like a warning but now just sounds like a sad statement of ongoing affairs:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“I used to think that I could never lose anyone if I photographed them enough. In fact, my pictures show me how much I’ve lost.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I decided to create my own deck of creativity cards. I was sick of all the adverts for similar products on Instagram. You know the kind. They&amp;rsquo;re covered in pictures, patterns, and buzzwords. You shuffle the cards and draw them one at a time. As you place each card on the table, the brain’s natural desire to tell stories, create patterns and produce meaning takes over.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I made a deck without too much thought for form or consequence. It was an unconscious collection of signs and symbols. The peaks of curves. Greek letters. Compartments, boxes, arrows. I told myself that I could create new things like this. I could break out of old mannerisms and entrenched thinking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;He keeps biting me on the leg&amp;rdquo; says Ingrid one day as I mill around her desk during the new water cooler moment that is a comfort break on a Microsoft Teams call. I pat Martok, one of our cats, and he rubs up against me, pretending that he might nibble at me too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I experience this regularly. It used to be at half five, then at five, and these days at half past four. He strides into my office, circles around the chair and nips me on the calf. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why it&amp;rsquo;s getting earlier each day. It&amp;rsquo;s probably a brazen campaign for dinner, but I have been steadfast in feeding them no earlier than the S of six.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post explains some of the modifications I made to a minimal Jekyll theme to get this blog as I wanted it. This blog (currently) uses the excellent &lt;a href=&#34;https://sidey-jekyll.netlify.app/about&#34;&gt;Sidey theme&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ronaldsvilcins.com&#34;&gt;Ronalds Vilciņš&lt;/a&gt;. His site looks eerily similar to this one, at least at time of writing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The theme is pretty minimal in terms of features (and appearance) but it scores well on the Google Page Speed test. The features I added have increased the build time, but have not affected the speed of the site in terms of the page speed test.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While sprucing up this blog a bit during lockdown, I fell into reading my old posts about &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/tag/south%20america/&#34;&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt;. I enjoyed it, mostly for the memories, but also because the current lockdown is warping my sense of time and space. Hours feel like weeks, but then I blink and a month&amp;rsquo;s gone by. I find myself traipsing similar orbits each day around the house, and then perhaps over to the supermarket or the park. There&amp;rsquo;s a palpable escapism to be had in reminiscing about South America and other places.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the course of a week on holiday, I started reading many interesting articles. In lockdown there isn&amp;rsquo;t much to do but read articles, but I still find myself not that good at finishing them. My phone has lots of tabs open and has become a Rolodex of shame. This post is to confess my sins.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m trying to re-familiarise myself with Python. As with all modern software development, Python now seems atomised and hyper-complicated. As a result, this series of posts from Claudio Jolowitz was useful. He cuts through lots of the complications and explains why they are there. Someone should ask him to write a book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ingrid bought me a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.raspberrypi.org&#34;&gt;raspberry pi&lt;/a&gt; for my birthday. I&amp;rsquo;ve set it up to run the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.pi-hole.net&#34;&gt;Pi-hole&lt;/a&gt; software. Pi-hole is a nifty bit of kit that intercepts your web requests and purges any that ask for material on known ad servers. Essentially it&amp;rsquo;s like having an ad blocker on your network rather than just your computer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve written before about &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/net-loss/&#34;&gt;why I hate web advertising&lt;/a&gt;, and since then it&amp;rsquo;s got even more malign. The use of our web browsing habits to track our every move and sell us crap has gotten way worse. Instagram is particularly &lt;em&gt;awful&lt;/em&gt; for it and gets more awful with every amendment that Facebook makes. An ad-blocking solution that works for apps as well as in the browser is especially welcome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I read this book on holiday in Belgium last year. Having forgotten to pack a novel I scoured almost every book in the Waterstones at St. Pancras station before settling on this Booker prize winning novel by George Saunders.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lincoln in the Bardo&lt;/em&gt; fictionalises a period in Abraham Lincoln&amp;rsquo;s life immediately after the death of his son Willie. The story alternates between factual accounts of what happened at the time and the observations of ghosts in the graveyard where young Willie is buried. Lincoln visits the grave several times over the course of an evening, something that causes costernation and intrigue among the ghosts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Amanitore of Nubia is available in a base game DLC. She also has her own scenario “The Gifts of the Nile”, which like most scenarios has unique tech and civic trees. You need to assert your dominance over the Nile by building seven temples. The scenario combines faith and military tactics in a satisfying way and you can also play it as Cleopatra for a different perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;These are some things I jotted down one day last week, I&amp;rsquo;ll refine them a bit more later on. Think of it as an aide-memoire of things that work for me, your milage may vary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about things that haven&amp;rsquo;t happened.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t turn whatever has happened and/or is bothering you into a catastrophe, especially if no one else is telling you that it is one. Seek out someone you trust and ask them &amp;ldquo;is this a catastrophe?&amp;rdquo; Not only will they say no about 99.9% of the time, they will often tell you why it isn&amp;rsquo;t a catastrophe.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The people who are important to you will not use your personal characteristics as a laundry list of personal failings in the same way that you do. In fact they won&amp;rsquo;t do it all. What you perceive as your own obvious and innate failings, others will often struggle to even see. Self awareness and hyper-awareness are two different things.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There will be people who don&amp;rsquo;t like you, people who don&amp;rsquo;t think you&amp;rsquo;re good enough, and people who won&amp;rsquo;t give you a chance. They most likely intersect, meaning there are fewer of them than you might think. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to satisfy these people, only those who like you and support you. Most of all, you have to be good enough for you.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Everybody has different needs and wants in life. Even though your needs and wants will often intersect with those of others, there is still no reason to use other people as the measure for what you should be getting out of life.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A person has more depth and dimensions than are measurable. If you focus solely on a single metric when you measure yourself against some standard or goal, you will be wrong in some way or another. A qualified and multi-dimensional validation of your progress will give you a more nuanced and more supportive sense of where you are heading and how to correct yourself.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Always focus on your capability. Regard potential as something to be shaped into capability.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Take time to think about things in many different ways, employing both proven mental models and lateral thinking.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Often problems are easier to tackle once you have been for a walk in the countryside.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Doves are a band from Manchester who traded dance music for rock yet never left their former genre behind. Starting out as Sub Sub, they scored a worldwide hit in 1993 with &amp;ldquo;Ain&amp;rsquo;t No Love (Ain&amp;rsquo;t No Use)&amp;rdquo;: a timeless dance tune that immediately owns whatever room it plays in. However, subsequent releases by Sub Sub did not catch on and people started to think of the band as a one-hit wonder.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alexander of Macedon is available in a base game DLC pack alongside Darius of Persia.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t written one of my monthly album digests for over a year. The reasons mostly boil down to a lack of time and motivation but other factors include the changing way in which I listen to music. I bought more albums on vinyl and only a small proportion of those were recently released music. Meanwhile, the attractions of Spotify&amp;rsquo;s release radar proved too great to resist: it is a very convenient way to consume new music.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ingrid and I love playing Civ VI. It&amp;rsquo;s a fine game that improves on previous versions, adding many layers and mechanics that mean you can vary your playing style. In fact, with the recent Gathering Storm expansion there&amp;rsquo;s now an incredible variety of ways to play. The 39 leaders to play with both reflect and provide the game&amp;rsquo;s increased complexity. Each leader has a slightly different mechanic that influences how you play the game, and of course the leaders you are up against also affect your game play. You can pick leaders to go up against that will make your game easier or harder. Some leaders can even be an existential threat if you spawn near to them and, as I&amp;rsquo;ve learned the hard way, it&amp;rsquo;s not always the leaders you expect that cause these problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

What has come after the things I managed to do?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First off, here&amp;rsquo;s my justification for writing the list in the original post:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Five years ago I set out at 3am for Heathrow airport to catch the early morning flight to Madrid. There I connected with a flight to Quito in Ecuador. The previous days and weeks had been fraught with worry about whether I was doing the right thing. Did I get the right vaccinations? Would I have enough money? Would I cope with all that travel? Was I coming back? What was I going to do with all my stuff?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Overstory&amp;rdquo; by Richard Powers piqued my interest among the novels shortlisted for the Booker Prize. And &lt;a href=&#34;satin-island-tom-mccarthy-review&#34;&gt;once again&lt;/a&gt; the book that interested me most did not win. One year I will succeed in my prediction!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I found &amp;ldquo;The Overstory&amp;rdquo; an enjoyable read. Its accessibility surprised me. Often people view Booker nominated novels as stuffy or over-intellectual. This novel however is a genuine page turner, full of emotion and heartbreak, not to mention plenty of science and awe of the natural world. Perhaps in another year it may have won.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For our &lt;a href=&#34;the-same-but-different&#34;&gt;first anniversary&lt;/a&gt; we decided to exhange books. What better way to &lt;a href=&#34;https://ideas.hallmark.com/articles/anniversary-ideas/anniversary-gifts-by-year/&#34;&gt;celebrate a paper anniversary&lt;/a&gt;? Ingrid bought me the entire Foundation saga, most of which were &lt;a href=&#34;https://abcoverd.co.uk/archive/designers/topping-mike&#34;&gt;reissued in fancy new paperback designs by Mike Topping&lt;/a&gt; in 2016. All save for 1993&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/7lueju/asimovs_forward_the_foundation_published_in_2016/&#34;&gt;Forward The Foundation&lt;/a&gt; that is, but Ingrid got me a copy anyway. Hence, here is a new series of blog posts!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Foundation novels detail a galactic empire in decline. A mathematician named Hari Seldon, using a novel science called psychohistory, realises that this is happening and formulates a plan for humanity, one that will reduce the time between empires. This, he reasons, will minimise human suffering and prevent an extended period of barbarism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>J. D. Vance, Hillbilly Elegy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27161156-hillbilly-elegy&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hillbilly Elegy&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; is the autobiography of JD Vance, a self-professed hillbilly made good who graduated from Yale Law School. I read it because reviews touted it as illustrating the economic conditions leading to Brexit and the implausible election of Donald Trump. As &lt;a href=&#34;space-between-this-and-that&#34;&gt;I wrote in an earlier post&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;m keen to learn about why Brexit happened. However, I think this book fails to provide an explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I enjoyed the book. It gave me plenty to think about. The story Vance tells is entertaining, but falls short of presenting a meaningful social and economic analysis of the plight of the white working classes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As much as I hate to write about writing, especially when I write so infrequently, I feel I need to reboot this blog. I wrote so few posts in recent months I considered giving up altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been stressed. Sometimes this manifests in being unable to sleep. Sometimes it manifests in all my interests and ideas seeming to be completely pointless. Sometimes one of those precedes the other. Sometimes it works vice versa. Often since getting back from Australia I’ve felt stuck in a vicious circle of insomnia and disinterest. Perhaps it’s just been the longest case of jet lag ever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;a href=&#34;articles/the-same-yet-different&#34;&gt;wedding present&lt;/a&gt;, Ingrid&amp;rsquo;s Mum Maria kindly took us for a trip along &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Ocean_Road&#34;&gt;The Great Ocean Road&lt;/a&gt;, the longest war memorial in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Stretching 151 miles from Torquay (not that one!) to Allansford, the road was deliberately built as a tourist attraction as a means of providing meaningful work for troops returning home from the First World War. Regarded as one of the world&amp;rsquo;s greatest scenic roads, it certainly holds it own against things like the roads I experienced in Chile and Bolivia when I travelled over the Andes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On our second full day in Australia we went shopping in central Melbourne, before Ingrid&amp;rsquo;s mum Maria picked us up ahead of our trip along the Great Ocean Road.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We took the metro into the city. I always love watching the fabric of cities knit itself together around train lines and Melbourne is no exception. Along the way, Ingrid had plenty of stories to tell about the various places she had lived.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Taking It Easy In Melbourne</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On our first full day in Melbourne we took it easy. It was warm and sunny, so different to the weather we&amp;rsquo;d left behind!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ingrid needed more time than me to sleep off her jet-lag. I sat in the sunshine and read the book I&amp;rsquo;d ignored on the plane. An easy read, it drew me into its characters. I&amp;rsquo;ll post a review later, perhaps after I have read the sequel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We left for Heathrow at 6AM and left London at around midday. I waved goodbye to home for nearly four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We stopped over in Dubai for an hour or so while the plane refuelled. We walked in circles trying to shake off the fatigue. I&amp;rsquo;d equalled one of my longest ever flights just getting to Dubai and now I was facing almost twice as much time again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not being much of a drinker, I&amp;rsquo;ve never felt the need to do &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/alcohol/Pages/dry-january-helped-me-take-back-control-of-my-drinking.aspx&#34;&gt;dry January&lt;/a&gt;. Also Ingrid and I sat in a restaurant in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mattischrome.com/spain-new-year-201718/&#34;&gt;Barcelona&lt;/a&gt; on January 2nd drinking for the third night in row. We hadn&amp;rsquo;t got off to that great a start. Well today marks the completion of a dry month: dry January with a two day lag.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also (mostly) managed to keep to my other goal of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/16/case-against-sugar-sweetness-and-blight-rachel-cooke&#34;&gt;eliminating sugar&lt;/a&gt; from my tea and coffee. This meant I cut out at least three teaspoons of sugar a day for a month. I can&amp;rsquo;t say it was easy. For a while I compensated by hoovering up the post-Christmas chocolates. Then came a period of the blues, though that was probably just &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias&#34;&gt;confirmation bias&lt;/a&gt;. They don&amp;rsquo;t call the third Monday of January &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/blog/truth-about-blue-monday&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;blue Monday&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; for nothing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year promises to be exciting so this week I tried to buy a diary. One of those day-to-a-page affairs for scribbling down all the things I&amp;rsquo;ve seen and learned about. I thought they might be cheap now the calendar is turning to February. No such luck. There were a few week-to-view diaries going for half price in Waterstones but nothing suitable for my needs. I have lots of Field Notes notebooks if my urge to write gets too much to resist.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ingrid and I renewed our Cineworld passes as it is the season to go to the movies and check out the Oscar contenders. You nod along sagely while dreaming up superlatives to show how much you agree with the taste-makers. Or you can call such-and-such movie a pretentious load of crap.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With &amp;ldquo;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s more the former. But I don&amp;rsquo;t have to say anything pretentious about the cinematography or its timeliness. Most people will recognise those elements. Instead, I can say it is a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; film. An enjoyable movie. A flat-out entertaining one in fact.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For new year Ingrid and I met up with Ingrid&amp;rsquo;s friend Ros at Barcelona airport. We went from there to Cadaqués on the Costa Brava. A winding drive over steep hills leads you down to a cute bay with the typical white houses and terracotta roofs. All the window frames were painted just the right shade of blue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;../../assets/images/cadaques/Spain01.jpg&#34; /&gt;&#xA;&lt;figcaption&gt;View of Cadaqués from the church.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;../../assets/images/cadaques/Spain02.jpg&#34; /&gt;&#xA;&lt;figcaption&gt;View of Cadaqués from near to where we stayed.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;../../assets/images/cadaques/Spain03.jpg&#34; /&gt;&#xA;&lt;figcaption&gt;A view of the hills you need to drive through to get in and out of Cadaqués.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The surrealist artist Salvador Dalí lived and worked in the area. This meant a trip to Figueres to see his Theatre-Museum and on new year&amp;rsquo;s eve a walk over the hill to Port Lligat to visit his house. Both required timed tickets. We couldn&amp;rsquo;t get into the Port Lligat house on our first day because there were no tickets left. Lucky for us that New Year&amp;rsquo;s Eve was so much better weather-wise!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Grails &amp;ldquo;Chalice Hymnal&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some albums are good because a band continues making the music that you love. Some albums are good because a band takes their ideas a step or two further than before. Chalice Hymnal is that rare album that does both of these things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The references to past albums include the track Deeper Politics and Deep Snow II, and, as per albums past, these tracks evolve slowly out of languid guitar hooks and smoky atmospherics. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Rolling Blackouts CF &amp;ldquo;Julie&amp;rsquo;s Place&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you just want a simple pop song about going out somewhere. I enjoyed the Rolling Blackouts&amp;rsquo; EP &amp;ldquo;The French Press&amp;rdquo;. It contains many catchy tunes &lt;a href=&#34;album-digest-march-2017&#34;&gt;as I noted in my review&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;ldquo;Julie&amp;rsquo;s Place&amp;rdquo; is the best, speaking of a need to be somewhere or a promise that you will go there. Given that I often listen to music between places, it&amp;rsquo;s nice to have a song or two like that on my playlist.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s a happier album compared to the emotional wreckage of &amp;ldquo;Vulnicura&amp;rdquo;. But while &amp;ldquo;Vulnicura&amp;rdquo; was a compelling if uncomfortable listen, &amp;ldquo;Utopia&amp;rdquo; is more comfortable and, unfortunately, not that compelling. This is old ground retrodden with few glimmers of past glories.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The brevity, succinctness and sharpness are all gone. Even on the best songs (the first three), there is very little strength in the lyrics. The music is all texture and no melody. And while formlessness and adaptability are central to the album&amp;rsquo;s lyrical themes, the songs themselves are ill-served by allowing these same concepts to take hold of their arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a recipe to use up your turkey leftovers after Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You will need a slow cooker or an oven-proof cooking dish.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;ingredients&#34;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;About four portions of cold turkey, torn into bite-sized pieces&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1 sweet potato, chopped into small slivers&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1 carrot, chopped into small slivers&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1 onion, diced&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;2 cloves of garlic, diced&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;2 tsp mixed herbs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;2 tsp smoked paprika&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;20g butter&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;50g diced chorizo&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1 chicken stock cube mixed in about 700ml water (see method)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;method&#34;&gt;Method&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Melt the butter and fry the onions on a medium heat until golden.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Add the garlic and fry this mixture for a further thirty seconds.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Add the diced chorizo and continue to fry, adding a little stock and turning down the heat if things get a little too sticky.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fold in the cold turkey and mix into the onions, garlic and chorizo.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Add half of the stock and bring to the boil.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Add the carrots, the sweet potato and the remainder of the stock.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Transfer to a slow cooker or the oven proof dish. If you&amp;rsquo;re using a slow cooker, you need to make sure liquid covers the contents of the pot.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Use the default high setting of your slow cooker, or cook in the oven at 160C for about two hours.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Check on the pot when about 30 minutes of cooking time remains. If you need to thicken the mixture, stir about a tablespoon of cornflour into about 20ml of water and then add this to the pot, stirring it in well.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Serve with rice and a green vegetable.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;iceland-part-two&#34;&gt;We left Gulfoss&lt;/a&gt; and drove through the countryside to Fluðir where our next hotel stay would be. The hotel had cute little cabins arranged around a central square and the room itself was comfy and warm. Our dinner was nice enough, although we had a bit of a Fawlty Towers moment with Ingrid’s chicken salad. First it went back because they didn’t leave the BBQ sauce off. Then it came back &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; tomatoes. And then back again with more BBQ sauce. Fourth time lucky.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After I read &lt;a href=&#34;hello-america&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hello America&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;like-a-mule-ice-cream-sun-manyika&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Like a Mule Bringing Ice Cream to the Sun&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; to Ingrid, it was her turn to read something to me. We settled on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.matthaig.com/reasons-to-stay-alive/&#34;&gt;Matt Haig&amp;rsquo;s memoir of anxiety and depression &amp;ldquo;Reasons to Stay Alive&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;, which is as uplifting and life-affirming as its title suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The book begins with its author standing atop some cliffs in Ibiza, crushed by depression and anxiety and determined to die. Fortunately he doesn&amp;rsquo;t go through with it and eventually this book detailing his experiences of recovery came out of it. It&amp;rsquo;s an honest warts-and-all account of what it&amp;rsquo;s like to be a depressed person and, perhaps even more crucially, what it&amp;rsquo;s like to live with a depressed person.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We cook this version of bolognaise with beetroot due to Ingrid&amp;rsquo;s tomato allergy. This recipe is an attempt to capture what we do on the fly. The key to it is using the wine, the Worcestershire sauce and the herbs to even out the sweetness of the beetroot. If you can manage that, it&amp;rsquo;s super tasty. The sauce usually ends up being an unusual but pleasing pink/purple colour, as you will see from the pictures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Little Lesson in R</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had to compute an indicator this week. It had confidence intervals that relied on taking 100,000 samples from the indicator&amp;rsquo;s approximate distribution. I had to repeat this over multiple GP practices and for twelve different demographic groups.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I decided to use &lt;code&gt;dplyr&lt;/code&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; because I thought it would help me organise all subgroups involved. I used &lt;a href=&#34;http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise_all.html&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mutate_at()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; heavily and thought that &lt;code&gt;dplyr&lt;/code&gt; was keeping everything organised. However, when I moved from the 10 samples I&amp;rsquo;d used for testing to the 100,000 samples required by the specification of the indicator, my code moved to a crawl. Fearing that my work laptop was a little puny, I left it running overnight on my Mac&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and by morning R was still holding up its infuriating little stop sign.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks I have worn a suit to work. I bought a new furry woolly suit a few weeks ago and have alternated between it and my old one. I also bought new shoes that gave me blisters and made me cry. Enough time has passed that by now it feels natural rather than silly and those shoes don&amp;rsquo;t eat my feet as much as they used to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think I feel calmer before I go to work as a result of wearing the suit. Suits are very little fuss. Pick the suit, pick the tie, job done. Besides, a suit flatters a man of my age and inclination towards biscuits. And finally my tie collection gets to see the light of day!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;mary-epworth-elytral&#34;&gt;Mary Epworth &amp;ldquo;Elytral&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This album came to my attention because its lead single &amp;ldquo;Me Swimming&amp;rdquo; appeared on my Discover Weekly playlist. I&amp;rsquo;d never heard of Mary before but this album was one of those nice discoveries that one sometimes makes when one tries to broaden what one listens to. The aforementioned &amp;ldquo;Me Swimming&amp;rdquo; is probably the best track, a beautiful slice of summery experimental pop layered over a beat that you can imagine as the kicks of a swimmer compared to the swirling lyric that imitates the pull of the strokes through the water. Or the other way round. I was a latecomer to swimming, I&amp;rsquo;m not very good at it. But I do know a good song when I hear one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Three years ago today I moved in to my little flat in Chichester, soon to start a new job. I had no money left but at least, after a character building stint of six months sleeping on the floor, I had a bed. In the intervening three years, my job role has expanded, I&amp;rsquo;ve done another degree, the flat has become a home, and I&amp;rsquo;ve met and married Ingrid. Add to that the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s almost four years since I left for South America and I start to realise that I&amp;rsquo;ve done a crazy amount of things in that time. I don&amp;rsquo;t intend to stop.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Like a Mule Bringing Ice Cream to the Sun&amp;rdquo; is a novella by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sarahladipomanyika.com&#34;&gt;Sarah Ladipo Manyika&lt;/a&gt;. Of all the books nominated for the 2016 Goldsmiths Prize, this looked like the most interesting to my eyes. I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed previous Goldsmiths nominated novels including &lt;a href=&#34;acts-of-the-assassins-richard-beard&#34;&gt;Acts of the Assassins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;satin-island-tom-mccarthy-review&#34;&gt;Satin Island&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The title comes from a poem by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/mary-ruefle&#34;&gt;Mary Ruefle&lt;/a&gt; called &amp;ldquo;Donkey On&amp;rdquo;. You can read it &lt;a href=&#34;http://thegreatnothingof1987.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/donkey-on-by-mary-ruefle.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Like a Mule&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; is set in contemporary San Francisco and takes the form of multiple first person narratives, centred around Dr. Morayo da Silva, an elderly Nigerian woman who is approaching her 75th birthday. The novel explores old age, memory, and how we use those things as a filter through which we perceive ourselves and others.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps in today&amp;rsquo;s modern age of streaming and such, &lt;a href=&#34;http://thecoral.co.uk&#34;&gt;The Coral&lt;/a&gt; would be a bigger band and may have survived their eventual burnout. Their work ethic was evident from the start, as rumours swirled &lt;a href=&#34;https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/YdkAAOSwfl9XBSiR/s-l300.jpg&#34;&gt;in the NME&lt;/a&gt; about a fantastic new band from Liverpool who were going to blow everybody&amp;rsquo;s socks off. I went to see them live in Bristol after they&amp;rsquo;d released three EPs and they were incredible. Their sound, a bit like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071615/&#34;&gt;the movie &amp;ldquo;Holy Mountain&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; set to pop music, imagined a Merseybeat channelled from an alternative universe in which Lennon and McCartney took their acid in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.desertusa.com/mojave-desert.html&#34;&gt;the Mojave desert&lt;/a&gt; rather than in the English suburbs. Yes, it was derivative but somehow it also managed to be utterly new and compelling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;iceland-part-one&#34;&gt;After a day on foot in Reykjavík&lt;/a&gt;, and with some trepidation, we returned to the car for our drive through Iceland&amp;rsquo;s countryside. We started by heading out on route 1, which is like Iceland&amp;rsquo;s M25 except that it encircles an entire country &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; about thirty times fewer people. We went to house of Nobel Prize winner Halldór Laxness, only to be turned away because it was being renovated and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t open for another month. Undeterred, we pressed on toward &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Eingvellir&#34;&gt;Þingvellir&lt;/a&gt;, stopping off on the way to take pictures at a viewpoint. It was just crazy, a flat expanse of undisturbed snow. Just as with the drive from the airport, the territory should have been relentlessly bleak but instead we got a winter wonderland.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

At the time, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know much about her, other than the fact she was famous for painting flowers. And that people get a bit hot under the collar about what those paintings might represent. Was the art world of the 1920s and 1930s so repressed that it managed to get into a lather about some paintings of flowers? And more importantly, are they any good?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://approachingpavonis.blogspot.co.uk&#34;&gt;Alistair Reynolds&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a&gt; 2000 novel &amp;ldquo;Revelation Space&amp;rdquo; has long been in orbit of my science fiction &amp;ldquo;to read&amp;rdquo; list, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until one sleepless night (post &lt;a href=&#34;command-and-control&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Command and Control&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;) that I came across it in Ingrid&amp;rsquo;s audiobooks. I was instantly drawn in as I listened to the opening scene about an archaeological dig facing evacuation ahead of an imminent &amp;lsquo;razor storm&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Revelation Space&amp;rdquo; is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/hard_sf&#34;&gt;hard sci-fi&lt;/a&gt; set in a universe where the speed of light cannot be exceeded. Most of the action takes place in the 26th century, with the narrative also recounting earlier events as the story progresses. Humanity has expanded to five or six systems beyond our current solar system, using huge colony ships that travel at 99.9% of the speed of light. This means that &lt;a href=&#34;http://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/everyday-myths/relativity10.htm&#34;&gt;relativistic effects&lt;/a&gt; play an important role in the narrative. A lot is made of the difference between sleeping away the decades between star systems and subjectively experiencing them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love making plots in R with &lt;code&gt;ggplot&lt;/code&gt;. However, there are always a few niggles that I forget about between plots. I wrote this post so that I have somewhere to look the next time I need to tweak a few things in my plots. I intend to come back and add updates in the future as I learn more things. If I keep coming back, I might also remember a few of these too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We arrived in Reykjavík a few days &lt;a href=&#34;https://weather.com/news/news/reykjavik-iceland-record-snowfall-february&#34;&gt;after a monumental snowstorm&lt;/a&gt;. As such the city was still under at least six inches of snow. We collected the hire car from the airport and drove out of Keflavik. The scenery normally looks like a moonscape, but for us it was a frosty white wonderland.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../../assets/images/iceland/iceland_01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After about an hour&amp;rsquo;s drive, we arrived at the Hotel Nattura. From the outside it looks like a huge secondary school but as soon as you step inside it&amp;rsquo;s warm and comfortable. This is quite good when you&amp;rsquo;ve just parked next to a snow bank that&amp;rsquo;s two and half metres tall and then bambi&amp;rsquo;d it in over the icy paths with your luggage.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had low expectations for &amp;ldquo;Hello America&amp;rdquo;, the next in &lt;a href=&#34;j-g-ballard&#34;&gt;the series of Ballard novels&lt;/a&gt; that I started reading over seven years ago. However, it turned out to be a hoot. A couple of years ago, this novel would have been a wig-out bit of standard Ballard weirdness (a bit like &lt;a href=&#34;the-drowned-world&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Drowned World&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;the-crystal-world&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Crystal World&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;) but given recent events &amp;ldquo;Hello America&amp;rdquo; is starting to take on an eerie prescience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hello America&amp;rdquo; (1981) is set a hundred years from now in an alternate time-line where oil production peaked in the late sixties. Without a viable energy supply the North American continent depopulates and the Russians dam the Bering strait in order to turn Siberia into farmland to feed the American refugees. Meanwhile, the continental United States turns into a desert wasteland due to the resulting climate change. The 44th president (President Brown) was the last before America depopulated entirely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ingrid and I got married a month ago. It was a lovely day. We had a simple ceremony with two witnesses, our friends Sue and Andrew. We kept it quiet and small, as we just wanted to be married without too much fuss. A month on, we&amp;rsquo;re happy to report that we are glad we did it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;d like to thank everyone who nonetheless sent cards and gifts, and to all of those who wished us well on Facebook. Much as I&amp;rsquo;m wary of social networks this did seem to be one of those events to which an announcement on Facebook was well suited. We intend to have additional celebrations at some point in the near future so keep your eyes peeled. We&amp;rsquo;re aware that our little dyad cannot be the only point where our families intersect. We hope to overcome that, but it is those sorts of complications that drove us to a smaller scale event in the first place. I&amp;rsquo;m very keen on the &amp;lsquo;win the lottery and hire a few private jets&amp;rsquo; approach but they keep selling me faulty tickets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Command and Control&amp;rdquo; by Eric Schlosser is about the history of nuclear weapons and their safety. This might not seem like a thrilling subject, but it&amp;rsquo;s absorbing from start to finish. I started it three years ago but only finished it more recently as the subject of nuclear weapons has become more pertinent to current affairs&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We bought a cheap package holiday in the British Airways Black Friday sale. The weekend spanned Ingrid&amp;rsquo;s birthday, so it was ideal. £99 each for flights and a hotel, and we bagged a hire car quite cheaply too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because our flight was from Heathrow and the trains from Chichester are both expensive and inconvenient for early flights, we spoiled ourselves with a taxi to the airport. It felt very strange to be whisked through the Sussex and Surrey countryside at six am on a Friday morning!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I came late to Orbital&amp;rsquo;s work. I knew of them through a few remixes and because as a mad Orb fan, they could not have avoided my notice could they? Apart from that, one of my college friends tried to get me into &amp;ldquo;In Sides&amp;rdquo; just after its release in 1996. The same friend got me into &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/understated-classics-11/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Second Toughest In The Infants&amp;rdquo; by Underworld&lt;/a&gt;. I cannot now understand the reason, but &amp;ldquo;In Sides&amp;rdquo; just left me cold.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my last post, I wrote about hills. I tried to use them as a metaphor to explain nagging sense of incompletion when you single out one activity over another. The feeling that there&amp;rsquo;s always a more exciting hill off in the distance to go climb, instead of the one you&amp;rsquo;re on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I said my next post would be about how to pick between different options, particularly when you have many to choose from. This post is not that. This is a short piece about an experience I had in South America that relates to the hills post: about contentment in the moment and letting things go.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of books. The way they transport you away to other places and so on. As repositories of knowledge and adventure they can&amp;rsquo;t be beat. I can think of no better way out of an existential fix than reading.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The trouble is I tend to hoard them. I&amp;rsquo;ve posted pictures of &lt;a href=&#34;https://mattischrome.com/reading-list-mid-april-2012/&#34;&gt;book stacks before&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;https://mattischrome.com/another-reading-list/&#34;&gt;on more than one occasion&lt;/a&gt;). I could probably repeat that every month if I wanted to, perhaps even more often. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a networked thinker, able to see (at least superficially) the connections between all sorts of things. Because of this I get excited and enthusiastic about all kinds of things, and I want to learn them all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed Wonder Woman, which came as a surprise to me given my growing distaste for superhero movies. &lt;a href=&#34;man-of-steel-a-short-review&#34;&gt;I can remember seeing the Superman reboot Man of Steel&lt;/a&gt; with its phallic rockets and its boring boring fight sequences. But almost everything about Wonder Woman exceeded my expectations. It&amp;rsquo;s a well-made superhero movie and better still, it gets to the heart of why these kinds of movies matter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whereas Man of Steel ended up levelling cities and criminally underusing Amy Adams, all while giving us no stake on why Superman even matters as a man or a hero, Wonder Woman focusses tightly on its main character and explains what matters to her, and in turn the movie then explains why she should matter to us. In other words, it&amp;rsquo;s not boring and it&amp;rsquo;s not pointless.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It can be a struggle to keep writing. I&amp;rsquo;ve found this happened a lot since I moved the blog. First, there was  the business of moving things over. That meant a lot of thought about old posts and which ones I should keep. A lot of the time I thought &amp;ldquo;how on earth did I have time to write this?!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then there seemed to be a lot more barriers to writing than previously. We can say what we like about the machinery that WordPress runs on, it does make it easy to write regularly. It also provides a lot of tools for making writing fun and for learning things as you go. I still have access to those things but it&amp;rsquo;s a little different now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;moving-the-blog-to-jekyll-again-sort-of&#34;&gt;Moving the blog to Jekyll (again, sort of)&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Et voila, my blog lives! In a new body (&lt;a href=&#34;https://jekyllrb.com&#34;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;) and at &lt;a href=&#34;%7B%7Babsolute.url%7D%7D&#34;&gt;a new location&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-process&#34;&gt;The Process&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I set up Jekyll on my MacBook Air after loads of initial problems with installing the theme and getting assorted Ruby gems installed and working. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.stackoverflow.com&#34;&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt; is a friend for life now. By way of comparison, getting things up and running on my new Mac was simple.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;blanck-mass-world-eater&#34;&gt;Blanck Mass &lt;em&gt;World Eater&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This album is pretty extreme. It&amp;rsquo;s not for everyone and even for the people who &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; handle it, it&amp;rsquo;s not for all the time. This album is a soul crushing experience at points but there are also points of light. Perhaps this makes “World Eater” more reflective of life as a whole than any other of this month&amp;rsquo;s albums. On balance it&amp;rsquo;s probably less crushing than the last Blanck Mass album “Dumb Flesh”, which I reviewed back in June 2015.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Some albums are good because a band takes their ideas a step or two further than before. &lt;em&gt;Chalice Hymnal&lt;/em&gt;is that rare album that does both of these things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The references to past albums include the track &lt;em&gt;Deeper Politics&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Deep Snow II&lt;/em&gt;, and, as per albums past, these tracks evolve slowly out of languid guitar hooks and smoky atmospherics. If it ain&amp;rsquo;t broke don&amp;rsquo;t fix it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He has past form for this, having revisited his masterwork Tubular Bells twice (the third revisit and fourth instalment Tubular Bells 4 is due next year). I wrote about Tubular Bells II for my understated classics series. Of course Mike has in fact made many more than three Tubular Bells albums&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, and this is not a first &amp;ldquo;return&amp;rdquo; to Ommadawn. His 1990 album Amorok was a similar affair.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The next instalment in my understated classics series is &amp;quot;Stray&amp;quot; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://killermontstreet.net&#34;&gt;Aztec Camera&lt;/a&gt;. Released in 1990, it features two hit singles and the cover is my favourite colour: green.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My angle for writing about “Stray” was that it was an album that I &amp;quot;caught&amp;quot; from my parents. I soon realised that I wrote about some of those already, for example “The Circle and the Square&amp;quot; by Red Box. Besides, I’m not sure that my parents liked this album that much.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gimletmedia.com/show/heavyweight/about/&#34;&gt;Heavyweight&lt;/a&gt; is a podcast about “heavyweight” issues, in the sense of burdens on the soul, rather than the burning issues of the day. It’s presented by Jonathan Goldstein, who was the host of the WireTap podcast. Each week he helps someone resolve an issue from their past. These include resolving family feuds and understanding mid-life depression.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am a generalist who often takes a broader view of things. Heavyweight reminds me that the emotions of individuals are as important as the wider trends that affect groups. It’s helped reinforce my recent thinking that one leads to the other and that it’s more of a causal relationship than we might think. Despite my interest in the general, I’m a microeconomist at heart.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

She is considered to be one of South America&amp;rsquo;s best artists. Known mostly for her abstract paintings, she also experimented with sculptures and installations. Many of her works use text and semiotics to explore and define possible meanings for more abstract works.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I saw this exhibition during its run in the Tate Modern in the Autumn of 2013. I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like writing about it at the time. In fact I may not have had any time because it was quite close to my departure for South America.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This month&amp;rsquo;s album digest features albums by Wilco, M.I.A., Local Natives, and a collaboration between Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith and Suzanne Ciani.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;wilco-schmilco&#34;&gt;Wilco &lt;em&gt;Schmilco&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schmilco&lt;/em&gt; is the tenth studio album by Wilco, which regular readers will know are one of my favourite bands. &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/whatever-happened-to-that-hat/&#34;&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no need to repeat that anecdote about why this blog has the name that it does.&lt;/a&gt; Meanwhile, this album follows on from last year&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; and is probably the third Wilco album to have a jokey meta- kind of title. (The other one is the rather splendid &lt;em&gt;Wilco (The Album)&lt;/em&gt; from 2009.) I didn&amp;rsquo;t write a review of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;; it  was released for free and for some reason it passed me by. &lt;em&gt;Schmilco&lt;/em&gt; is a fairly similar album and that&amp;rsquo;s not a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, Ingrid and I went to see The Threepenny Opera at the National Theatre.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Threepenny Opera was written by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill, based on Elisabeth Hauptmann&amp;rsquo;s German translation of John Gay&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;A Beggar&amp;rsquo;s Opera&amp;rdquo;. It was first performed in Weimar Berlin in 1928 and has evolved over time through many adaptations, including several film and off-Broadway versions. It&amp;rsquo;s a work with very powerful musical overtones and, despite avowals otherwise throughout by the narrator, it has a powerful moral message.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Witness the pressure of a new notebook. You sit at your desk, trying to get it started with an amazing piece of writing. Something worthy of that crisp new page. You want it to tumble out of you, fully formed and coherent. Something that justifies you abandoning the previous one. As though first drafts don&amp;rsquo;t exist. You cast yourself into the role of shaman, of seer - of someone gifted a prophetic vision. But it&amp;rsquo;s a role that you cannot and will not fulfil.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A little man wearing a bow tie, and possibly a fez, scurries into the middle of the frame clutching a clapboard. Breathing heavily he hoists the clapboard up to chest height. He holds the clapper up then brings down while slurring &amp;quot;This is a blog post about not having a clue, take 43&amp;quot;. He exits to the right of the frame.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My feet are hot. The bed seems too small. Why are my feet always too hot on nights like these? I bet I could sleep if my feet weren&#39;t so hot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post, I allowed Spotify to pick some new albums for me this month. It chose some noodly ambient techno, a captivating slice of World Jazz, a moody gothic hallucination, and a concept album about humans being rescued by aliens. All in all a pretty good job! Here is the list:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Prins Thomas &amp;ldquo;Principe del Norte&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sarathy Korwar &amp;ldquo;Day to Day&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Doomsquad &amp;ldquo;Total Time&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;United Vibrations &amp;ldquo;The Myth of the Golden Ratio&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;prins-thomas-principe-del-norte&#34;&gt;Prins Thomas &amp;ldquo;Principe del Norte&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/orb-alpine-diskomiks-sin-in-space-pt-2/&#34;&gt;Prins Thomas recently remixed the Orb&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Alpine EP&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; so I&amp;rsquo;m not surprised that Spotify included one of his tracks on my Discover Weekly playlist. The connection was obviously waiting to be made. &amp;ldquo;Principe del Norte&amp;rdquo; was released back in March and features 9 tracks over almost 90 minutes. Each track title is a single letter, save the first two which are labelled A1 and A2. I think it was B that caught my attention, a proper old school ambient tune but one with some teeth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any albums coming out this month that I wanted to review for the album digest, I decided to let Spotify pick the albums to listen to. I listened to my algorithmically chosen &lt;a href=&#34;https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/20/why-browse-when-you-can-play/&#34;&gt;Discover Weekly&lt;/a&gt; playlist one week and selected albums based on the songs that I liked the most. The album also had to be released in 2016. The selections are ones that got away.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve done this before. &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/album-digest-august-2012/&#34;&gt;Three of the four albums that I wrote about in August four years ago&lt;/a&gt; were selected by &lt;a href=&#34;https://bleep.com&#34;&gt;Bleep&lt;/a&gt;: they were in the &amp;lsquo;best albums of the year so far&amp;rsquo; bundle that I bought. So this month&amp;rsquo;s album digest is bought to you by the same idea, just a different curator.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The bill included a brand new work by &lt;a href=&#34;http://piershellawell.com&#34;&gt;Piers Hellawell&lt;/a&gt;, along with a Cello concerto by &lt;a href=&#34;http://classicalmusic.about.com/od/classicalcomposers/p/haydnprofile.htm&#34;&gt;Haydn&lt;/a&gt; and a symphony by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pyotr-Ilyich-Tchaikovsky&#34;&gt;Tchaikovsky&lt;/a&gt;. These were all performed by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ulsterorchestra.org.uk&#34;&gt;Ulster Orchestra&lt;/a&gt;. The conductor was Rafael Payare. The tickets were an affordable £17 each which isn&amp;rsquo;t bad at all given that we were sat in the second row of the circle. We had a great view.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Album Digest July 2016 consists of a bumper five albums, mainly because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t work out which one to drop. I think they&amp;rsquo;re all pretty good though it&amp;rsquo;s great to hear new music from The Avalanches after all this time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;bat-for-lashes-the-bride&#34;&gt;Bat For Lashes &amp;ldquo;The Bride&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For her fourth album as Bat For Lashes, Natasha Khan applies her considerable songwriting skills to a concept album. She sings from the perspective of a bride whose husband dies on his way to their wedding. Almost all artists would deliver this subject matter in a melodramatic way, but Khan focusses on the sadness and delivers a beautiful suite of songs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It uses a modern crime genre style and a contemporary setting. The author himself refers to it as &amp;ldquo;Gospel Noir&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;Cassius Gallio, a Roman CSI-type referred to as a speculator, investigates the murders of the apostles following the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus. Gallio, charged with guarding the body following Jesus&amp;rsquo; death and greatly undermined by the disappearance of the body, views the resurrection as the greatest conspiracy of the age.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understated Classics #33: Embrya by Maxwell</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/understated-classics-33/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I give the impression of planning these posts but to be honest I came across an article about Maxwell a few weeks ago and fondly remembered my cassette copy of this album. The joy of Spotify is that it&amp;rsquo;s easy to dig up old favourites. The recent warm weather makes for a good opportunity to enjoy the sultry embrace of &amp;ldquo;Embrya&amp;rdquo; once more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Gestation: Mythos&amp;rdquo; burbles along for two and a half minutes, overlaying spoken word samples, string phrases and weird underwater noises, before the bass line of &amp;ldquo;Everwanting: To Want You To Want&amp;rdquo; brings things to life. Over a sinuous and aquatic background, Maxwell delivers a smooth and soulful vocal. As you might guess from the title, it&amp;rsquo;s definitely one for your late nights and warm evenings playlist. I love the way that the song takes its time: it knows where it needs to go, it knows how to get there, and damned if it isn&amp;rsquo;t going to enjoy itself on the way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;uyuni-to-tupiza&#34;&gt;Uyuni to Tupiza&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We left Uyuni the night after the big storm, having stopped just a day or so to visit the salt flats. Our next stop was a strategic stay in Tupiza, a large town encircled with red hills. It resembled many towns that I visited in South America: low buildings arranged in a grid pattern. Not much greenery and plenty of dust billowing about. The reason for our stay was strategic, it&amp;rsquo;s only a short distance to the notoriously fussy border between Bolivia and Argentina. We would leave at 5am the next morning so we would reach the border early in case of a long delay, which can happen at this border.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The subject of this post is &amp;ldquo;The Unlimited Dream Company&amp;rdquo;, my favourite among his novels: a silly romp through suburban sexual repression that glitters with sinister wit. Even after many read-throughs I still can&amp;rsquo;t work out whether it is a crazy masterpiece or something light that we&amp;rsquo;re meant to throw away after reading.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Swaptastic Part 3: The Shiny App</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The shiny app embedded below allows you to explore the number of packets you need to complete the Panini sticker album for this summer&amp;rsquo;s Euro tournament. This builds on the results I presented in an [earlier post](link to earlier post) and allows you to explore how many fewer packets you need to buy when you have more friends to swap with. You can also vary the number of runs performed because the model runs considerably slower with more swappers involved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Album Digest June 2016 is a poppy batch of albums. We have the return of my long-time favourites Roxette and the heroes of my South American tour Tegan &amp;amp; Sara. There&amp;rsquo;s some dance music in the form of Flume&amp;rsquo;s album &amp;ldquo;Skin&amp;rdquo;: an Australian presence ahead of the new Avalanches album next month. Finally there is the first of two new albums by Islands - both were released back in May but one gets reviewed this month and the other next month.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a follow-up to my post about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/euro-2016-panini-stickers/&#34;&gt;Euro 2016 Panini Stickers&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ve now completed the collection with &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/swaptastic-part-1/&#34;&gt;the help of an online swapping site&lt;/a&gt; and by buying the last 39 stickers directly from Panini. I also managed to write a new simulator, this time with additional collectors involved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I assume that each of N collectors will buy a packet of stickers and add any new stickers to their album. Then they attempt to swap any leftovers with the rest of their friends. The intersect function in R makes this pretty easy to code up. Every collector who finishes the album stops buying stickers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Britain voted to leave the EU this week. It made for an angry and confused Friday morning. I posted snippy comments on Facebook at a rate of about one every fifteen minutes. I also knew that there was nothing I could do. Even when you feel like Charlton Heston at the end of &amp;quot;Planet of the Apes&amp;quot;, you have to suck it up and accept that sometimes things don&#39;t go as you like.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As I mentioned in a previous post, I have used &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.stickerswapping.com&#34;&gt;the sticker swapping website&lt;/a&gt; to share my swaps with people all over the UK. I have sent swaps off to London, Bristol, Cornwall, Lancashire, Wales, and Gloucester. You&amp;rsquo;ll also be happy to know that I got my hands on an Aleksei Berezutski. Only 52 left to go!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Time for a little gear review. This is the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/multi-device-keyboard-k380&#34;&gt;Logitech K380 keyboard&lt;/a&gt;. It pairs with devices wirelessly over Bluetooth. I bought it to use with my Apple TV, iPad and iPhone. It runs on 2 AAA batteries, but the supplied batteries are not rechargeable. The keyboard is light and portable but you definitely know you have it in your bag.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s lovely to type on. For a go-anywhere keyboard it has a surprisingly nice feel to the keys. It also gives equal weight to Windows and Mac keys, so it&amp;rsquo;s quite easy to use across both platforms. The only frustration is that the iPad doesn&amp;rsquo;t support keyboards as it should and the iPhone is even worse. I&amp;rsquo;m expecting that to change in iOS 10, which is due to be announced at WWDC next week. Of course, none of this is the fault of the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sound the conspicuous consumption klaxon! 📣 I know it&amp;rsquo;s foolish but I decided to collect the Panini stickers for the Euro 2016 tournament this summer. I think it&amp;rsquo;s a more edifying waste of money than a series of group game accumulators that don&amp;rsquo;t come off. If this week&amp;rsquo;s long read in The Guardian is anything to go by, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/31/big-gamble-dangerous-british-betting-shops&#34;&gt;we really shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be giving any more of our money to betting companies&lt;/a&gt;. The album also looks better than any of the official books. Anyway, this post celebrates my inner collector/geek and the beauty of the shiny sticker!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Album Digest May 2016 features the work of four bands or artists that I have reviewed in previous album digests. I also own (or will own) all of these albums on vinyl, so it&amp;rsquo;s handy that I&amp;rsquo;ve recently bought myself a record player!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;radiohead-a-moon-shaped-pool&#34;&gt;Radiohead &amp;ldquo;A Moon Shaped Pool&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Radiohead released &amp;ldquo;A Moon Shaped Pool&amp;rdquo; online about three weeks ago and a physical version hits the shops later in June. As with all of their recent albums, it is (mostly) a slow burner that rewards multiple listens.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2016 marks the centenary of the birth of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP3=CMS3&amp;amp;VF=MAGO31_9_VForm&amp;amp;ERID=24KL534M5N&#34;&gt;Werner Bischof&lt;/a&gt;, the talented Magnum photojournalist who died in Peru in 1954, aged 38. He travelled widely, making the most of an incredible talent for photography. After the second world war, this led him all over Europe to document its aftermath. As the cold war began, Bischof found himself documenting events further afield.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We saw two exhibitions of his photography at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.elysee.ch&#34;&gt;Musée de l&amp;rsquo;Elysée in Lausanne&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;ldquo;Point of View&amp;rdquo; explores his international work spanning the years 1945 to 1954. &amp;ldquo;Helvetica&amp;rdquo; explores his earlier work while isolated from travel in Switzerland during the second world war.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Something Coming Through&amp;rdquo; is a science fiction novel set in the near future. A few years after a brief nuclear war known as &amp;ldquo;The Spasm&amp;rdquo;, an alien race known as the Jackaroo introduce themselves to humanity. The novel is funny, thoughtful, and politically charged. I found it to be a good read.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The aliens have given humanity fifteen &amp;ldquo;gift&amp;rdquo; worlds and an automated way to access them. Think of the Docklands Light Railway but with space shuttles. These worlds contain artefacts and remnants from their previous occupants. Movement between the worlds has also changed the Earth: it suffers from incursions by invasive species brought back from the other worlds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This month&amp;rsquo;s album digest is a mixture of comparisons. First we compare the fortunes of old hands Underworld to even older hands the Pet Shop Boys. After that I&amp;rsquo;ve found two dance albums, one that I liked and one that I didn&amp;rsquo;t. I find it quite hard to write about dance music and so the comparison is quite useful. Sometimes it helps to work out why you like one thing and not another.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just before Easter Ingrid and I went to Lausanne in Switzerland for a few days. It was a much-needed break and my first trip out of the UK since I got back from South America.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We caught an early train to Gatwick. It took a strange route along the coast via Worthing and Hove, which was annoying because we could have left later if a more direct train were available at that time of day. At least it wasn&#39;t late, which for Southern is really rare.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Orb return with a new EP on the &lt;a href=&#34;www.kompakt.fm&#34;&gt;Kompakt label&lt;/a&gt; called &amp;ldquo;Alpine&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Alpine&amp;rdquo; is split in to three tracks &amp;ldquo;Morning&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Evening&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Dawn&amp;rdquo;. The third of these was included on the 2016 edition of Kompakt&amp;rsquo;s annual &amp;ldquo;Pop Ambient&amp;rdquo; compilation, a gently drifting track with plenty of bells and yodels. A diversion from the sounds of &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/album-digest-june-2015/&#34;&gt;Moonbuilding 2703 AD&lt;/a&gt; (and its presumably ongoing remixed companion EPs), but it sat nicely with the other tracks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought I&amp;rsquo;d add three of my favourite David Bowie albums to my review of Blackstar to a form an album digest tribute. Also among my favourites but not included here is &amp;ldquo;Outside&amp;rdquo;, which will be included in the understated classics (currently it&amp;rsquo;s number 66) at some point. I thought about bumping &amp;ldquo;Outside&amp;rdquo; up the running order but I&amp;rsquo;d like to be objective about it when its turn comes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;station-to-station&#34;&gt;Station To Station&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not the side effects of the cocaine / I&amp;rsquo;m thinking it must be love&amp;rdquo; sings Bowie on the title track of his tenth studio album &amp;ldquo;Station To Station&amp;rdquo;, released in 1976. But this album is most definitely almost entirely built on cocaine, from the weird Kabbalah channeling title track, to the smooth funk of &amp;ldquo;Golden Years&amp;rdquo; and on toward to the weepy conclusion of his cover of &amp;ldquo;Wild Is The Wind&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For Ingrid&amp;rsquo;s birthday, we went to see &lt;a href=&#34;http://moscowcityballet.com/en/repertoire/ballet/1&#34;&gt;The Nutcracker performed by the Moscow City Ballet&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;http://kingsportsmouth.co.uk&#34;&gt;The King&amp;rsquo;s Theatre in Southsea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The original conversation went something along the lines of &amp;ldquo;Matt, please come and see some ballet with me on my birthday! It might not be your thing but I&amp;rsquo;d love someone to come and see it with me&amp;rdquo;. As I&amp;rsquo;ve always loved a bit of Tchaikovsky, I said yes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My only previous encounter with a ballet was an adaptation of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_II_(ballet)&#34;&gt;Christopher Marlowe&amp;rsquo;s Edward II by John McCabe&lt;/a&gt; during my English Literature A-level. We got a day trip to exotic Bristol out of it, which when I was 17 meant the chance to visit all the cool record shops looking for rare KLF vinyl that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford. We also got underage hammered at the pub before going to the Hippodrome to watch a ballet in which a man flounced around with a giant pink strap-on on (as if male ballet dancers didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough of that action going on already!). Needless to say, it did little to convert me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Given that I gave up on writing album digests for a bit this year, I thought I would at least do a proper top ten list of my favourite albums. There are quite a few albums that I did not have room for and I might try to revisit those later. In the mean time, let&amp;rsquo;s crack on. (To save time, I have in some instances pasted my original review from the appropriate album digest.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am writing a long post that I will either publish as one long post (about five or six thousand words) or as about seven smaller ones each closer to the average post length of about eight hundred words. I have to get it out-of-the-way soon as my mind needs to focus on my health economics essay.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is hard to write short posts to a timetable, let alone churn out long posts on a regular basis. As a result, this longer post is not likely to become the norm. It&amp;rsquo;s an idea I had that bloomed into something ever bigger and this time I decided to have a crack at it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week Underworld reissued their excellent second album “Second Toughest In The Infants” in various formats including a four disc super deluxe edition. I wrote about this album in my understated classics series and I want to share some thoughts on the reissue. I love this album so I was excited to hear the remaster and the additional material.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can’t comment on the physical version of the release as I can’t afford it at the moment. I also had to wait to buy the gorgeous yellow reissue of “Dubnobasswithmyheadman” but the “Second Toughest In The Infants” box is on the list. Underworld do a really good job on the boxes with interesting artwork to accompany the large volume of material. If the “Dubnobasswithmyheadman” box is anything to go by, the new one will be pretty hefty on the coffee table.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As much as I wanted it to, Satin Island by Tom McCarthy did not win the Booker Prize. Having read it all I realise it was a long shot. However it is an interesting book that deserved consideration, even if it does have some flaws.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Normally I promise that there will be no spoilers. Not this time. There are some spoilers here. Because it took me so long to work out what I thought Satin Island was actually about, I want to use this post to explore those ideas. I promise to keep the amount of plot exposed to a minimum. Given that at first glance the novel appears plotless, I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have too much trouble. &lt;strong&gt;However, please read the novel before you read this review, unless you don&amp;rsquo;t intend to read it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understated Classics #32: They Were Wrong So We Drowned by Liars</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As it is Halloween, I&amp;rsquo;m writing about a spooky understated classic. Liars&amp;rsquo; second album &amp;ldquo;They Were Wrong, So We Drowned&amp;rdquo; is a concept album about witches. It was the first of their albums that I owned having heard their name mentioned among those in the New York Post-punk revival scene at the start of the 00s.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I imagine that to most ears a first listen to &amp;ldquo;They Were Wrong, So We Drowned&amp;rdquo; sounds dreadful. I certainly thought so. It&amp;rsquo;s a short album and if you plough through it there are one or two nuggets that would sound great on most albums - but a lot of it initially seems to be noise and chanting and screaming. If anyone wants to make the argument that Liars are not worth the trouble, not worth the effort to like or understand, then &amp;ldquo;They Were Wrong, So We Drowned&amp;rdquo; is the album they will use as ammunition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why but it got released earlier than any of the dates that I&amp;rsquo;d seen and so on Saturday I found myself watching The Martian on the big screen. Could the film version deliver the same level of entertainment as the novel? Could Mark Watney (Matt Damon) get off Mars alive?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/10/man-booker-shortlist-2015-satin-island/408784/&#34;&gt;Satin Island&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; is my pick for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://themanbookerprize.com/man-booker-prize-2015&#34;&gt;Man Booker prize&lt;/a&gt;, announced tomorrow. I&amp;rsquo;ve not managed to read all of it yet. Also, I&amp;rsquo;ve only glanced at the others on &lt;a href=&#34;http://themanbookerprize.com/news/man-booker-prize-fiction-2015-shortlist-revealed&#34;&gt;the shortlist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My prediction record on selecting the winner of the Booker from the shortlist is pretty good, though all I&amp;rsquo;m ever doing is guess the outcome of a 1 in 6 chance, like the roll of a die. Often it&amp;rsquo;s a book that I really hope will win rather than one I know will (except &amp;ldquo;Wolf Hall&amp;rdquo; and its sequel). I still think the world is a worse place for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/fictionreviews/3665324/Man-Booker-2007-Prize-Darkmans.html&#34;&gt;Nicola Barker&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Darkmans&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; not winning the prize back in 2007. I was delighted when &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/oct/11/books.bookerprize2006&#34;&gt;Kiran Desai&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Inheritance of Loss&amp;rdquo; won the previous year&lt;/a&gt;. That&amp;rsquo;s part of my affection for &amp;ldquo;Satin Island&amp;rdquo;, it&amp;rsquo;s a book that will make people go &amp;ldquo;huh?&amp;rdquo; if they&amp;rsquo;re driven to reading it via a prize win.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ben Elton, Time and Time Again</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Time and Time Again is a ridiculously stupid novel by Ben Elton. A shadowy sect (established by Isaac Newton no less!) recruits a soldier to go back in time and prevent Franz Ferdinand&amp;rsquo;s assassination in Sarajevo in August 1914. I wonder if it all goes to plan and everyone lives happily ever after with no weird timey-wimey after-effects?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Needless to say &lt;strong&gt;this novel makes me wish that time travel were a real thing so that I could travel back in time and slap myself in the face while in the queue to buy this tripe.&lt;/strong&gt; I usually try to see the best in the books, albums and movies that I write about, but the most fun you can have with this novel is to rip it to shreds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Y-12 is the United States&amp;rsquo; most secure weapons-grade Uranium storage facility. It is known as the &amp;ldquo;Fort Knox of Uranium&amp;rdquo;. In 2012 it was infiltrated by three elderly peace protesters, sparking a major scandal about the safety of US nuclear sites. &amp;ldquo;Gods of Metal&amp;rdquo; by Eric Schlosser tells the story of that break-in alongside a history of both the anti-nuclear movement (in particular &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plowshares_Movement&#34;&gt;the Plowshares movement&lt;/a&gt;) and nuclear security in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to write honestly about your feelings. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to write about your feelings consistently, for a living on a regular basis. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to write about your feelings when the world constantly intrudes with inanity, insanity and hatred. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to write under those conditions without seeming frayed, without coming loose at the edges.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Get To Heaven&amp;rdquo;, the third album by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.everything-everything.co.uk&#34;&gt;Everything Everything&lt;/a&gt;, was forged under these stresses and pressures. For most of its running time it sounds like either a bomb ticking down to explode or like a clock inexorably counting up missed opportunities and stolen moments. It sounds for all the world as though it is trapped between fight and flight, paused between action and apathy. Yet it also subjects the listener to the yammerings of a culture that has driven itself mad. Depth and surface, glass and steel, truth and lies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Inherent Vice: A Short Review</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight I finally caught up with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inherent_Vice_(film)&#34;&gt;Inherent Vice&lt;/a&gt;, Paul Thomas Anderson&amp;rsquo;s adaptation of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Inherent-Vice-Thomas-Pynchon/dp/0099542161/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1437860132&amp;amp;sr=8-4&amp;amp;keywords=inherent+vice&#34;&gt;Thomas Pynchon&amp;rsquo;s novel&lt;/a&gt;. It stars &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001618/&#34;&gt;Joaquin Phoenix&lt;/a&gt; as Larry &amp;lsquo;Doc&amp;rsquo; Sportello who&amp;rsquo;s put on to a case of possible kidnapping by his &amp;ldquo;ex-old lady&amp;rdquo; Shasta, played by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/16/katherine-waterston-jk-rowlings-fantastic-beasts-harry-potter&#34;&gt;Katherine Waterston&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no point attempting to tell much more you of the plot of Inherent Vice: it&amp;rsquo;s rather convoluted and self-digesting. At least this means there&amp;rsquo;s very little chance of stumbling into inadvertent spoilers. However, most of the plot strands do fall into place by the end, much more than I&amp;rsquo;d imagined they would half way through.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This little masterpiece was released in 1991. I got my copy on cassette for Christmas that year, but by May in 1992 they&amp;rsquo;d already &amp;ldquo;retired&amp;rdquo; and split up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The KLF were a band in the right place at the right time with the right idea. Taking advantage of synthesizers and the idea of fusing rock and pop music with the emerging sound of house music, they laid the ground for many of the most successful electronic acts that followed them. They were also master showmen, taking a whole host of crazy conspiracy theories and smooshing them together in one stadium-sized package.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/jackson-x/&#34;&gt;I wrote about an idea for a novel that I&amp;rsquo;d abandoned&lt;/a&gt;. I mentioned in that post that I&amp;rsquo;d abandoned it because there was another idea that I wanted to pursue. The working title for it is &amp;ldquo;Untitled 2&amp;rdquo;. (It isn&amp;rsquo;t really, I have an actual working title that would give things away or would at least make me feel like the idea was out in the world.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I often ponder whether the joys of waking up early are greater than those of staying up late. Empirical evidence seems to bear this out: all those people who get to work before you do, super-eager to get everything done. But then all the people walking under your windows late at night, drunk and laughing, they sound like they&amp;rsquo;re having a whale of a time too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I oscillate between the two extremes, though I tend to sleep better if I stay up late. My natural sleep hours are 1am to 8am, though I am usually human if I can get up just after 7. Whenever I try to stick to getting up early, to do masochistic things like running or being organised, I often find it harder to get to sleep or I wake up at 3 rather than 6. I end up second guessing my alarm clock.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Minions got their own movie, just as I predicted in &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/despicable-me-2-a-short-review/&#34;&gt;my review of Despicable Me 2&lt;/a&gt;. I went to see it this week and I enjoyed it a lot. Here&amp;rsquo;s a short review. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry, there are no spoilers here that aren&amp;rsquo;t in the trailer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s very funny. Right from the opening credits you get the minions and their anarchic fun-loving slapstick humour. There&amp;rsquo;s always been something delightful about they way in which they innocently bumble around. Their penchant for evil bosses is inexplicable but incredibly amusing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I should have known better than to use that clickbait title. I knew I wasn&amp;rsquo;t writing about the product, more the flatness of its introduction (despite the names on show).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After a few days of living with it I thought I&amp;rsquo;d write about it and Spotify, so that it&amp;rsquo;s not just my snarky comments about the keynote that are on record here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/album-digest-june-2015/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;To reboot this series, Album Digest June 2015 features five fantastic albums from Hot Chip, Jamie xx, Blanck Mass, Holly Herndon, and The Orb. I could pick loads more as I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to a lot of albums since &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/album-digest-february-2015/&#34;&gt;February&lt;/a&gt; but I decided to focus on the more electronic material. This means that I have no excuses for not continuing next month with a rockier theme.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;hot-chip-why-make-sense&#34;&gt;Hot Chip &amp;ldquo;Why Make Sense?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hot Chip seem to be settling in to a pattern with their album releases, alternating between messy experimental affairs and then a state of the art correction. Witness how &amp;ldquo;The Warning&amp;rdquo; smartened up the all-over-the-place &amp;ldquo;Coming On Strong&amp;rdquo; and how &amp;ldquo;One Life Stand&amp;rdquo; moulded and matured the lovestruck meandering of &amp;ldquo;Made In The Dark&amp;rdquo; into a lithe ten song set. &amp;ldquo;Why Make Sense?&amp;rdquo; takes the earnest song-based approach of &amp;ldquo;In Our Heads&amp;rdquo; and casts it into a funky fun-filled fifty minutes. It&amp;rsquo;s as concise as they&amp;rsquo;ve been since &amp;ldquo;One Life Stand&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A brief rant about Facebook: I hate the fact that the news feed defaults to “Top Stories” even though I change it back to “Most Recent” every time I log in. It’s a horrible pattern of user abuse that needs to stop. Time is time and that is that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So why does Facebook feel the need to jiggle things about into a random order? Well most of you have that mobile phone app of theirs that sucks your battery and your data allowance like crazy (mainly by auto-playing videos like a dick). They know you’re checking your Facebook on the loo at work and that that limits your interaction time. During this precious interlude they want you to see the stuff that they think interests you and the things that other people paid for you to see. You’re going to see some hick’s new tattoo, at least one photo of someone else’s child and an advert telling you to vote Conservative - whether you like it or not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The site aims to help people who know at least one programming language to learn others by proving a quick run through of the main language features. It&amp;rsquo;s not quite enough to get you up and running. After all, having sample code doesn&amp;rsquo;t get you the compiler. However, it&amp;rsquo;s a nice start that shows you how similar (and different) language X is compared to the one(s) you already know.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s assume that Jim has just had a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_United_Kingdom_bank_rescue_package&#34;&gt;sudden unexpected expenditure&lt;/a&gt;: a neighbour released a bull into his back garden and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/nov/01/creditcrunch.subprimecrisis&#34;&gt;it destroyed his conservatory&lt;/a&gt;. Let&amp;rsquo;s assume that the conservatory is essential to Jim&amp;rsquo;s wellbeing, so it has to be fixed immediately. As a result Jim&amp;rsquo;s debts, which &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/03/senior-tory-financial-crash-was-purely-a-banking-crisis-not-labour-overspend&#34;&gt;were previously small and well-managed&lt;/a&gt;, have now increased somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously Jim can&amp;rsquo;t keep that debt hanging over him forever. What does he do?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for Jim, the circumstances of his borrowing aren&amp;rsquo;t so different before and after the event. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/interest-rates/9922941/Interest-rates-predictions-Four-more-years-of-0.5.html&#34;&gt;Interest rates are low and are predicted to stay low&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21554311&#34;&gt;terms of his credit haven&amp;rsquo;t changed a great deal despite his increased borrowing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a reason I cannot and will not vote Conservative, and like most people&amp;rsquo;s apparent motive for voting tory it is also a selfish one. As someone employed in the public sector, working to ensure the greater good, I&amp;rsquo;m a member of an increasingly endangered species.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ah Matthew, I hear you say, you&amp;rsquo;re trotting out the old &amp;ldquo;the turkeys have voted for Christmas&amp;rdquo; line. Well no, like I said, this is purely selfish. When you mark that X in the box, you tend to think about yourself only. Never mind the turkeys (for now).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The thirtieth understated classic is by a band named after a fish. There isn&amp;rsquo;t a great deal for me to say about &amp;ldquo;Our Aim Is To Satisfy&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; apart from the usual insistence that it is quite good. There&amp;rsquo;s no overarching theme to write about, and no deep personal story attached. It was bound to happen eventually.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Our Aim Is To Satisfy&amp;rdquo; is one of those albums spawned in the late nineties and early naughties at the height of the Electronica boom: dance music that you didn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily have to dance to. It&amp;rsquo;s not quite chill out music but nor is it song-based (for the most part) - it&amp;rsquo;s mainly instrumental electronic music.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The other night “Bart After Dark” was on and I really enjoyed seeing it again. It’s from season eight, the one where Bart ends up working in the Maison Derriére. I thought it was older; mind you, this makes it nineteen years old. When I thought about the episode later on that evening, I realised how the story anarchically set out in multiple directions before settling into its main storyline. This still happens in newer Simpsons episodes, though the show is rarely as joyfully chaotic now as it was back then.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I received a copy of The Martian by Andy Weir for Christmas. This week during some annual leave I managed to finish it. It&amp;rsquo;s one of those novels that just flies by once it gets going. I&amp;rsquo;ve stayed up incredibly late to read it as it is full of those &amp;ldquo;just one more page&amp;rdquo; moments. It’s a readable and enjoyable story of an astronaut trapped on Mars.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mark Watney is believed to be dead following an accident during an emergency evacuation in a dust storm. With his life support readings at zero and unable to locate his body to be certain, his crew reluctantly abandon him on the red planet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1935156/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1&#34;&gt;Jodorowsky&amp;rsquo;s Dune&lt;/a&gt; is a documentary about outlandish Chilean director &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandro_Jodorowsky&#34;&gt;Alejandro Jodorosky&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; attempt at a film adaptation of &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/dune/&#34;&gt;Frank Herbert&amp;rsquo;s Dune&lt;/a&gt; in the 1970s. As a big fan of the novel and of science fiction in general, I was very interested in this film. It does not disappoint. It gives a great insight into the mind of a little known (if slightly batty) director and shows even an artistic failure can lead to shock waves that can be felt in later work by others.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is so much good writing out there. All you have to do is fire up &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/uk/&#34;&gt;the guardian website&lt;/a&gt;, or download the &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/m/app&#34;&gt;medium app to your smartphone&lt;/a&gt;, or visit &lt;a href=&#34;http://xianity.me/&#34;&gt;my friend Barrie&amp;rsquo;s site&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://narami.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;Lee&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt;, and so on and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to my little whisper into this great choir, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to feel a bit intimidated. How do I add my voice? How do I feel distinct? How do I do it as well as all these other wonderful writers?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night an impromptu firework display occurred. I watched it from my bathroom window. Very pretty and somewhat extravagant, given that there’s no reason for one on the calendar. I could have filmed it on meerkat but it would have diminished the spectacle. However, it did at least motivate me to write this piece that I have put off for a while (since about November I guess?). One where I find out (i.e. &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks&#34;&gt;look up on Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;) how fireworks work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Glow is about a guy called Raf, a Londoner whose life is going nowhere in particular; a state of affairs not helped by “Non-24 Hour Sleep/Wake Syndrome”. One night while experimenting with a new ecstacy-like drug that’s apparently derived from a social anxiety medication for dogs, Raf meets a beautiful girl and then loses her to the crowd in a blink-and-you-miss-it moment. From there a conspiracy evolves involving the titular dog-medication-derived drug, Burmese dissidents, corporate espionage, pirate radio stations, and urban foxes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The cat is out of the bag for streaming music now, and no matter how much music companies cry foul they can&amp;rsquo;t stop Spotify and their ilk, and there wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be pots of gold waiting for them even if they could.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s a very different sound to SYRO and sounds acoustic for the most part. It&amp;rsquo;s an important experiment about the role of the musician, one that is already blurred in the creation of electronic music.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I listened to Let It Come Down by Spiritualized for the first time during a difficult time in my life. I think this will always affect my feelings towards it. For me it&amp;rsquo;s a great big comfort blanket of a record. Coming after one of the all-time best break-up albums (in an artistic sense) in &amp;ldquo;Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space&amp;rdquo; perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s not that much of a surprise. Layered in orchestras, horn sections, and gospel choirs, it&amp;rsquo;s not understated at all but hopefully I can persuade you that it is a classic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty close to a round number. To date I have written 298,500 words for this blog, not counting posts that I have discarded or deleted. This will be the 505th post currently on the blog, which makes for an average of just under 600 words per post. Some posts are just a picture or a video or a gallery though, so that distorts the average a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I can write the 1500 words I need to hit 300,000 in this post. It’s quite hard to write on demand and I often feel like my bright ideas are unassailable when I sit down to type them up. I’m conscious that I have to keep turning up to type but I’m not sure that it’s worthwhile to write posts like this simply to keep up a streak. A blog should be like an iceberg: the heft below the water line will make everything above it more beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On The Humble Cheese Grater</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t beat a good cheese grater. Cheese just tastes better in a sandwich once it has been grated. It&amp;rsquo;s been proven by ACTUAL SCIENCE that this is the case: something about the increased surface area making it taste more zingy (NB. QI is not actually a peer-reviewed scientific journal). Of course the cheese we are grating here is a nice mature cheddar, you can&amp;rsquo;t grate Camembert or Stilton (well &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; you can, but why would you?). There are even cheeses that can be grated but don&amp;rsquo;t deserve it, take Red Leicester for example: the ear wax of the cheese world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I set myself the task of writing about a fictional character for this blog post, so this post is about Jackson X. His surname isn’t really X, it’s just one of the details about him that I haven’t fleshed out yet. This is because Jackson X is the one of the protagonists of the novel I’m (not) writing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The name of the novel is “The Summer of the Giant Space Whale”. I’m quite happy to discuss its plot and structure here. I don’t need to worry about anyone stealing the idea because it is already a rip-off of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112537.Rendezvous_with_Rama&#34;&gt;Arthur C. Clarke’s “Rendezvous With Rama”&lt;/a&gt; (or, less charitably, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092007/?ref_=nv_sr_1&#34;&gt;“Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home”&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We hear a lot about our rights but these are given to us in return for fulfilling our responsibilities. One of these is engagement in the democratic process, and in particular voting. You should register to vote, that’s a no brainer. You should take an interest in what politics means for you locally, nationally, and internationally. On the day you to get to the polling station and cast your vote. Then you need to hold you representative accountable afterwards, even if he or she isn’t the person you voted for.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Album Digest January 2015 rounds up a few albums from the tail end of 2014 that I didn&amp;rsquo;t get much time to write about. The only one of these six to be released this month is the excellent &amp;ldquo;No Cities To Love&amp;rdquo; by Sleater-Kinney.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;sleater-kinney-no-cities-to-love&#34;&gt;Sleater-Kinney &amp;ldquo;No Cities To Love&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had heard of Sleater-Kinney before their boxed set “Start Together” was released in 2014. I was quite impressed that they curated their own Spotify playlist with the contents of the box. I added it and even downloaded the songs for offline listening but didn’t get around to much more than a cursory play of a few tracks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/understated-classics-28/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the first lines of &amp;ldquo;The House That Guilt Built&amp;rdquo;, the soft cricket-laden lament that opens The Meadowlands by The Wrens, is &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m nowhere near where I thought I&amp;rsquo;d be&amp;rdquo;. The last line of the whole album is &amp;ldquo;this is not what you had planned&amp;rdquo;. These bookending lines set the tone for this shimmering, ramshackle masterpiece - a fatigue and careworn pride in failing to meet impossible standards writ large over its first and last eighty or so seconds. &amp;ldquo;The Meadowlands&amp;rdquo; is probably the best record you&amp;rsquo;ve never heard, and once you have heard it, you will never be the same. Even better, it changes and you change with every single listen. If you&amp;rsquo;re living your life and you really mean it, then this is the record for you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Feersum Endjinn is one of Iain Banks&amp;rsquo; few non-Culture sci-fi novels. Like the Culture novels, an existential crisis drives the plot: in this case the action takes place on Earth in the far future and the sun has aged to a point where it will grow and swallow the earth. This is referred to as the Encroachment. The characters are divided between the good guys who seek to find a solution for the greater good and bad guys who use the Encroachment to consolidate their power and influence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a brief message to wish everyone a happy new year. Getting my flat connected to the internet continues to be a trial so it&amp;rsquo;s still not as easy to post as I would like. However, I have some workarounds now and I hope to write (and post) more often from now on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Like everyone I make resolutions at this time of year, though as the years pass I realise that the best resolutions are to apopt a new way of being rather than a new way of doing. I find it quite difficult to &amp;ldquo;change&amp;rdquo; myself by willpower alone. I think this is true of most people. Travelling taught me that it&amp;rsquo;s better to evolve. I just do one little thing differently and then try to notice the benefits as they accrue. As you become are of how you are changing it gets easier and you can shift your focus to doing another little thing a bit differently, a bit better. At least that&amp;rsquo;s the theory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Overlong reflection upon the past is one sure way to make yourself unhappy so I try to avoid it. Nevertheless it becomes unavoidable at this time of year, especially if, like me, you are somewhat prone to reflection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At this time last year I was, &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/articles/south-america-trip-part-11/&#34;&gt;as detailed in the most recent report of my South American adventure&lt;/a&gt;, in La Paz, Bolivia. I think I felt as lost then as I do now, though back then I had the novelty of new places and good friends to steer me through. This year I find myself stuck in an expensive flat that I can hardly afford to heat in a city where I hardly know anyone: it seems ridiculous that I had more people around me in La Paz than I do here but there you go.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently started a new job and moved in to a new flat. This means I&amp;rsquo;m too busy to write any long blog posts at the moment. Also I&amp;rsquo;m still not quite at home there, so I tend to spend my evenings tidying up or setting up new things. It&amp;rsquo;s a shame because I have plenty of things to write about (even without observations on moving, starting a new job, etc) but I guess the writing will happen eventually&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This might be the last of these that I&amp;rsquo;m able to write for a while.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-not-reading-the-pale-king&#34;&gt;On Not Reading &amp;ldquo;The Pale King&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Pale King&amp;rdquo; is the third and final novel by American author &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newsweek.com/david-foster-wallace-appreciation-david-gates-89371&#34;&gt;David Foster Wallace&lt;/a&gt;. He was working on it when he committed suicide in 2008. It was compiled from incomplete notes and released posthumously in 2011.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Album Digest September 2014 contains four amazing albums, including the long-awaited return from the Aphex Twin, and an album from Cymbals Eat Guitars released about a week after I wondered what had happened to them. Spooky. Rounding out the selection this month are a cool punky-disco album by The Juan Maclean and a truly remarkable offering by Vessel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;aphex-twin-syro&#34;&gt;Aphex Twin &lt;em&gt;SYRO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;SYRO&lt;/em&gt; is the sixth album by Aphex Twin and his first official Aphex Twin release since Drukqs in 2001. Announced with a typically cryptic track listing at a month&amp;rsquo;s notice via the dark web, along with artwork that resembles a tax receipt for the costs of releasing the album, his anarchic streak appears intact. Therefore the most suprising thing about SYRO is just how conventional it sounds on first listen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/generate-random-numbers-in-r/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post deals with how to generate random numbers in R. It is good to know how to generate random numbers with a particular language or software package for at least one of the following three reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You want to test something that depends on a particular distribution.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You’re running a stochastic process of some kind (Branching process, random walk etc) and you need random numbers for deciding whether an event occurs.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You forgot to pick your lottery numbers this week.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let’s step through doing each of these with R. Over time I will write this post out again for C++, Java, Python, and Ruby. This post is just a memory aid that I can use later on and is not meant as anything more rigorous than that. As such it is a living document, I will mutate this post in place as and when I need to. Memory aids are useful for when you haven’t used a particular programming language or software package for a while. Who knows, it might save me a couple of searches with DuckDuckGo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently finished reading &lt;em&gt;All The Birds, Singing&lt;/em&gt;, the second novel by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eviewyld.com&#34;&gt;Evie Wyld&lt;/a&gt;. It’s about a woman called Jake who lives alone on a farm with a dog called Dog on an island somewhere off the coast of Britain. She has sheep to look after but something keeps coming in the middle of the night to kill them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, as the narrative on the island moves forward in the present, a second narrative peels off backwards to explain her past. This takes place in Australia. Jake is still working with sheep but there is a confrontation with a fellow farmhand who threatens to expose a secret from her past. As this second strand unfurls, we begin to see why Jake is jumpy and convinced that the deaths of her sheep represent ill-portent. However, because this second story rolls backwards in jumps, we have to wait until the end for the terrible events that set her on this path.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The album digest returns with five albums by four artists.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Karl Hyde &amp;amp; Brian Eno &lt;em&gt;Someday World&lt;/em&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;HIGH-LIFE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lone &lt;em&gt;Reality Testing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;FKA twigs &lt;em&gt;LP1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mogwai &lt;em&gt;Come On Die Young: Appendix&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;karl-hyde--brian-eno-someday-world--high-life&#34;&gt;Karl Hyde &amp;amp; Brian Eno &lt;em&gt;Someday World&lt;/em&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;HIGH-LIFE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m a big fan of both Karl Hyde’s work with Underworld and of Brian Eno’s stuff so Someday World seemed like a dream collaboration to me when it was released last May. I was a bit underwhelmed by it, to the point of overlooking it for &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/album-digest-may-2014/&#34;&gt;May’s album digest&lt;/a&gt;. Last month they released a follow-up called High-Life, which includes some of the more experimental tracks they’d worked on. Together the two albums are greater than the some of their parts, so I’m writing about both of them together this month.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Haruki Murakami, Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki And His Years Of Pilgrimage</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/colorless-tsukuru-tazaki/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki And His Years Of Pilgrimage is the latest novel by Haruki Murakami. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/19/haruki-murakami-marketing-publishers-stickers&#34;&gt;It comes with free stickers&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps that tells you everything you need to know about this book, which is slimmer than Murakami&amp;rsquo;s recent efforts. The plot begins with an intriguing premise. Tsukuru is part of a group of close friends and is one day expelled from the group for no reason. Unfortunately, the development of the plot is uncontrolled and by the end  of novel too many holes have developed for it all to hold together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It has a simple drafting model that makes it easy to organise ideas and move between them. Pieces of writing are represented as sheets that can be tagged and grouped together - the grouping can be made manually or using filters. There are no files, the sheets are entries in a single database that is synced with iCloud. Because everything is plain text it won’t eat up your storage space. Individual sheets can be archived for use with Mac Os X’s versions feature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/whatever-happened-to-that-hat/&#34;&gt;I have already given some of the personal background to why I love this album&lt;/a&gt; and now it’s time to give a bit of love to the music itself so I’ll stick to giving a track by track account of “A Ghost Is Born”.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are familiar with Wilco’s first few albums, you’ll know that A Ghost Is Born is on the line of best fit through Being There, Summerteeth, and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. It continues its predecessor’s experimentation, but also gets reined in a little. Great songs - some of my favourite Wilco songs - were left off Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (“&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bemydemon.org/songs/venus.htm&#34;&gt;Venus Stopped The Train&lt;/a&gt;”, “&lt;a href=&#34;http://wilcoworld.net/#!/song/a-magazine-called-sunset/&#34;&gt;A Magazine Called Sunset&lt;/a&gt;”) so the follow-up could easily have been more of the same and everyone would have gone home happy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

So much for exploration. We waited out the downpour in a pizza place and deliberated over whether to buy souvenier snaps from the tour guides. Ironically for a town named after hot waters, it was bitterly cold. One of those places where the sound of running water follows you wherever you go, the best thing about it was the huge trains that ran down the middle of street - big clanking hulks pulling huge passenger trains.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This is her last novel and is a remarkable book: inventive, funny, and sad, all at once. I found it in a special selection at the local library dedicated to Brazil because of the World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First some biography. Born Chaya Lispector in Chechelnyk, Ukraine, in 1920, her family escaped the pogroms and emigrated to Brazil in 1922. She was given the new name Clarice as the family settled in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lonelyplanet.com/brazil/the-northeast/maceio&#34;&gt;Maceió in north-eastern Brazil&lt;/a&gt;. Later she and her family moved to Rio de Janeiro&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and she started law school there in 1937. Her first published short story appeared around 5 years later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently spruced up a post I wrote four years ago about &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/articles/uc4/&#34;&gt;Biosphere’s wonderful album Substrata&lt;/a&gt;. I added the following footnote about the difference between voice samples and found sound:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suppose I am distinguishing between found sound and vocal samples here. Perhaps there is very little difference, or that one is the other? When is a vocal snippet something more than found sound? Is it the fact that one has meaning? Isn’t a “meaningless” sample - like the ones here in Russian that I can’t understand - little more than found sound anyway?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finally&lt;/em&gt; saw Guardians of the Galaxy today. Here are fifteen observations about the film that may or may not constitute a short review.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;At least two Oscars for &lt;a href=&#34;http://media.comicbook.com/uploads1/2014/07/guardians-of-the-galaxy-gamora-101682-101718.jpg&#34;&gt;Best Use Of Body Paint (Green)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://images.radiotimes.com/namedimage/Karen_Gillan_takes_on_Zoe_Saldana_in_extended_Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_trailer.jpg?quality=85&amp;amp;mode=crop&amp;amp;width=620&amp;amp;height=374&amp;amp;404=tv&amp;amp;url=http://localhost:1313/uploads/images/original/53103.jpg&#34;&gt;Best Use Of Body Paint (Blue)&lt;/a&gt; are sewn up.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Chris Pratt basically plays Star Lord as “&lt;a href=&#34;http://parksandrecreation.wikia.com/wiki/Andy_Dwyer&#34;&gt;Andy Dwyer&lt;/a&gt; in space” and this is fine by me.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Best movie to feature &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.etonline.com/movies/148845_bradley_cooper_explains_his_voice_guardians_of_the_galaxy/&#34;&gt;a talking raccoon&lt;/a&gt; in a long time.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://screenrant.com/thor-2-dark-world-mid-post-credits-button-scenes-explained&#34;&gt;Watching the entirety of the end credits of Thor 2&lt;/a&gt; paid off!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;“&lt;em&gt;WE&lt;/em&gt; are &lt;a href=&#34;https://uk.yahoo.com/movies/dancing-baby-groot-clip-guardians-of-the-galaxy-94738291414.html&#34;&gt;Groot&lt;/a&gt;” — aren’t we just?! All of the feels.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It features a dance off as a major event, something that it shares with the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Step_Up_(film_series)&#34;&gt;Step Up movies&lt;/a&gt;. Guardians of the Galaxy is a waaaay better movie.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The first words of the credits are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mtv.com/news/1887915/guardians-of-the-galaxy-sequel/&#34;&gt;“The Guardians of the Galaxy will return”&lt;/a&gt;. It is in fact a movie that reviews itself.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The 3D version might have been pretty good. I watched the 2D version but &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Guardians-Galaxy-Has-Something-Special-Planned-Its-IMAX-3D-43350.html&#34;&gt;the scenes with lots of action &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be improved with a bit of depth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/11033572/Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Awesome-Mix-soundtrack-tops-Billboard-chart.html&#34;&gt;A great soundtrack&lt;/a&gt;, but there is a cheesy “smooth rock wins chicks” bit that’s a little icky half way through.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;That said, the description of the legend of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087277/&#34;&gt;Footloose&lt;/a&gt; is hilarious. Especially the callback toward the end of the movie.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I especially enjoyed the scene with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.slashfilm.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-easter-eggs-quotes/&#34;&gt;the Collector&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Karen Gillen is wasted as Nebula, but &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Nebula-Return-Guardians-Galaxy-2-66648.html&#34;&gt;hopefully she will be back&lt;/a&gt;. Karen’s also in what may well be &lt;a href=&#34;http://abc.go.com/shows/selfie&#34;&gt;one of the most ill-conceived TV shows of all time&lt;/a&gt; later this autumn.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I thought it was Bruce Willis playing &lt;a href=&#34;http://whatculture.com/wwe/batista-praised-role-guardians-galaxy-movie.php&#34;&gt;Drax the Destroyer&lt;/a&gt; (I’m useless at this guess the actor game). I loved his taking things literally: “Nothing goes over my head. My reflexes are too fast, I would catch it.”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you text me at any point in the next month, I will probably reply with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nerdist.com/2014/08/translate-any-website-into-groot-speak-with-this-nifty-new-button/&#34;&gt;“I am Groot”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;No Raccoons or tree creatures were harmed during the making of this film.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;</description>

I was listening to this stuff at the age of 14 and now that I’m old enough to be a parent, that makes me a bit uncomfortable. Actually it does nothing of the sort, because it&amp;rsquo;s frigging awesome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you about punk rock: punk rock is a word used by dilettantes and ah&amp;hellip; and ah&amp;hellip; heartless manipulators about music that takes up the energies and the bodies and the hearts and the souls and the time and the minds of young men who give what they have to it and give everything they have to it and it&amp;rsquo;s a&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s a term that&amp;rsquo;s based on contempt, it&amp;rsquo;s a term that&amp;rsquo;s based on fashion, style, elitism, satanism and everything that&amp;rsquo;s rotten about rock &amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo; roll. I don&amp;rsquo;t know &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_Lydon&#34;&gt;Johnny Rotten&lt;/a&gt; but I&amp;rsquo;m sure&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m sure he puts as much blood and sweat into what he does as &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud&#34;&gt;Sigmund Freud&lt;/a&gt; did. You see, what sounds to you like a big load of trashy old noise is in fact the brilliant music of a genius, myself . And that music is so powerful that it&amp;rsquo;s quite beyond my control and ah&amp;hellip; when I&amp;rsquo;m in the grips of it I don&amp;rsquo;t feel pleasure and I don&amp;rsquo;t feel pain, either physically or emotionally. Do you understand what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about? Have you ever felt like that? When you just couldn&amp;rsquo;t feel anything and you didn&amp;rsquo;t want to either. You know? Like that? Do you understand what I&amp;rsquo;m saying sir? (Iggy Pop, Canadian TV, March 11th 1977.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The hat in question is a Wilco baseball cap that I bought at a gig of theirs in 2004, the night that Germany got eliminated from Euro 2004. I&amp;rsquo;d love to show you a picture of it but I can&amp;rsquo;t, there isn&amp;rsquo;t even a picture of it from a Wilco merch site: at least not one that Google or Bing images can see anyway. I did manage to find a side-on picture of it in my bedroom in 2005 and zoom right in on it like they do in CSI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://temporaryresidence.com/artists/watter&#34;&gt;Watter&lt;/a&gt; are a &amp;ldquo;supergroup&amp;rdquo; composed from various members of Grails, &lt;a href=&#34;http://touchandgorecords.com/bands/band.php?id=70&#34;&gt;Slint&lt;/a&gt;, and other bands. I did not know anything about Hundred Waters before this month: &amp;ldquo;The Moon Rang Like A Bell&amp;rdquo; is their second album. In fact second albums by bands I know nothing about are a something of theme because &amp;ldquo;Sunbathing Animal&amp;rdquo; is Parquet Courts&amp;rsquo; sophomore effort and I don&amp;rsquo;t know anything about them either. Meanwhile, I&amp;rsquo;ve meant to write about &amp;ldquo;The Four Seasons Recomposed&amp;rdquo; since April.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This month was strange. I didn’t listen to much new music and after &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/album-digest-april-2014/&#34;&gt;last month’s bumper digest&lt;/a&gt; there’s probably a reason for that. Not to mention that Spotify gives you more reasons to look backwards than forwards. Nevertheless, this brief post features new albums by Little Dragon and Coldplay, along with the mini-album collaboration between Röyskopp and Robyn.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;little-dragon-nabuma-rubberband&#34;&gt;Little Dragon “Nabuma Rubberband”&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I discovered Little Dragon, like most people, I imagine, via Gorillaz’ “Plastic Beach” album. When I investigated their “Machine Dreams” album I was surprised that their sound had transplanted to “Plastic Beach” intact. Sometimes you discover a band through a collaboration and their own work turns out to be disappointing, somehow diminished by the other artist(s) no longer being present. “Machine Dreams” is a fine album that breezes by, much like “Empire Ants” and “To Binge” do on “Plastic Beach”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am thinking about whether I want to use Dropbox to sync my files anymore. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I love Dropbox. It came along in beta in just 2008 just as I needed it to manage my PhD thesis. In fact I often jokingly claim to having invented it by asking on the MacRumors forums whether a program like it existed  - just a few weeks before its beta rode in to my life like a knight in shining armour. I recognised the need for a service that would synchronise a single directory and its contents between multiple computers using The Power Of The Internet™. I was used to using commands like scp to maintain my static blog on the university&amp;rsquo;s servers and the multiple computers that I authored it from, though in 2008 when I moved back to my parents&amp;rsquo; house to write up my PhD I was frustrated that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t work out how to do the same things when the target was a PC running Windows XP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m back in the UK so it’s back to posts about albums each month. This one is a bit different because I didn’t listen to very much new stuff while I was away so not all of the albums are up to date. I had to write about the new album by Liars though because it&amp;rsquo;s awesome and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait to discuss it! Here’s the list of albums:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tegan and Sarah &lt;em&gt;Heartthrob&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fanfarlo &lt;em&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s Go Extinct&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Liars &lt;em&gt;Mess&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;London Grammar &lt;em&gt;If You Wait&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;tegan-and-sarah-heartthrob&#34;&gt;Tegan and Sarah &lt;em&gt;Heartthrob&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would argue, as I have throughout my sequence of &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/tags#understated-classics/&#34;&gt;understated classics&lt;/a&gt; posts, that a great album is one that changes you as a person. Sometimes an album changes your mood consistently, sometimes an album makes you think about the experiences in your life differently, and sometimes an album is just so great and comes along at just the right time to knock you for six. I’d say that in 2014 Tegan and Sara’s “Heartthrob” has been that album for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>South America, Part 8</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Arequipa and Cusco &amp;ndash; the two cities that are the subject of this post &amp;ndash; are probably the two cities in Peru that are most amenable to travellers (though Lima certainly has a lot to offer too). For me they should have been punctuated with a trip to &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colca_Canyon&#34;&gt;Colca canyon&lt;/a&gt;, one of the deepest canyons in the world and twice as deep as the Grand Canyon. Unfortunately, I got really sick on the second day in Arequipa as my attempts at keeping my tummy bug at bay finally failed. (Even so, I didn&amp;rsquo;t actually seek any proper medical help till the second day in Cusco, I was pretty boneheaded about it.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Next up was a piecemeal section of the trip that took in a varied set of sights and helped us get to know the new passengers who joined in Lima. On the first day we took a boat trip out to the Ballestas Islands, a nature reserve that is informally known as “the poor man’s galapagos”. Living there are penguins, sea birds, sea lions and seals. The speed boat out was a little wet and wild (and in fact the return trip was even wetter and wilder) so we all got soaked (twice) but the microclimate around the islands themselves was calm and warm, and we all got good value out of our cameras (if they still worked that is). We even saw a pelican get taken down by a sea-lion which was an interesting if not altogether pleasant display of nature red in tooth and claw. Also, who knew that guano was so valuable?!?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From Punta Sal we took a long driving down to Huanchaco, via a stop off at the Lord of Saipan museum. The lord of Saipan is a Moche mummy found dressed in all manner of gold and surrounded by artefacts and other sacrifices (including other humans and decapitated llamas). The tour took a while to get going (our guide was late) but the exhibition was so amazing (the pieces were painstakingly restored in Germany) that it was hugely enjoyable. The diorama at the end featuring moving animatronic waxworks of Moche people was extremely weird though.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After Cuenca we set off for the Peruvian border. One of the great advantages of having a UK passport in South America is that you don&amp;rsquo;t need any visas. If you&amp;rsquo;re Australian or Canadian it&amp;rsquo;s a different story. Nevertheless we all got over the border with very little trouble (the third ever land border crossing of my life) apart from the bits where they seem to make you wait in a queue just for the sake of making you wait in a queue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After Baños, we set off for Cuenca, which is a town in the south of Ecuador. Being a long drive, the journey was broken up with our first excursion to some inca ruins, a large complex at Ingapirca with a sun temple. It was built on an earlier site that dated back to about the 9th century and the Inca then conquered the area and built on top of it, as they tended to while their empire was expanding out from Peru to the south in the 11th and 12th centuries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We left Misahualli for Baños via an hour in nearby Tena to get something for the truck fixed. After that the drive to Banos was pretty short - or at least it seemed that way as I alternated between dozing off, snapping the scenery and&amp;hellip; well&amp;hellip; dozing off some more. We arrived at a campsite about twenty minutes taxi ride from Banos and this was it, the thing I&amp;rsquo;d feared most about this trip: the camping. Fortunately, as an odd boy, I managed to secure my own tent - the gadget palace that you can see in my selfie! Getting the tent up was straightforward and all my assorted camping gear seemed to live up to requirements! It chucked it down with rain in the night, so it was good that the fly sheet did it&amp;rsquo;s job too. It was great fun to lie there listening to the rain, nice and warm and dry. More importantly, I also managed to get some sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a bit behind in my posts about the trip and this post interrupts the sequence of events somewhat, just because I&amp;rsquo;ve not felt that well and that has dominated my thoughts about what to write. Basically for a week or two I&amp;rsquo;ve had varying degrees of bellyache and it&amp;rsquo;s not been fun. Instead of feeling the gratitude and excitement I&amp;rsquo;ve felt since being here, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a lot of time wanting to curl up in the corner and just be&amp;hellip; well&amp;hellip; somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;otavalo&#34;&gt;Otavalo&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sunday (24th November) was our first day of travel and involved a four hour trip to Otavalo, a town to the north of Quito that is famous for its market&amp;hellip; on &lt;em&gt;Saturdays&lt;/em&gt;. The journey got us better acquainted with travel on our truck Magaly and we encountered a few of the little hiccups that are a natural part of travelling this way: power lines crashing down on to the highway, driver of your truck asking a policeman to take a photo of your truck snagged under the wires, wrong turns, and - funniest of all - getting a whole block&amp;rsquo;s worth of concerned locals to watch as your truck tries to turn a corner. Magaly is a wonderful truck, but subtle she is not!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By the time this goes up, I will be at least a week in to my South American tour. I flew out to Ecuador last Thursday (the 21st) and ended up being awake for more than twenty four hours. My flight left London early and I had a three hour stopover in Madrid, then a twelve hour flight onward to Quito. My bag didn&amp;rsquo;t leave Madrid though, so we were separated for about twenty four nerve-racking hours. Luckily, I&amp;rsquo;d packed a change of clothes and so I was still able to explore Quito with Lee and Miriam (fellow Tucan travellers) the next day without too much discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Four great albums this month for the last album digest in a while.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;chvrches-the-bones-of-what-you-believe&#34;&gt;CHVRCHES &amp;ldquo;The Bones Of What You Believe&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I first got into CHVRCHES on Record Store Day, one of my purchases was an Irn Bru coloured 12&amp;quot; of the Recover EP that, according to eBay, tripled in value over night. Judging by this, their full debut, my see-through orange slab of happiness may hold its value, because it&amp;rsquo;s clear that CHVRCHES should be around for the long haul. &amp;ldquo;The Bones Of What You Believe&amp;rdquo; is a master class in upbeat pop songwriting that doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to pander to the lowest common denominator.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/the-reset-button/&#34;&gt;in a previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I baked a chocolate cake the other day and it was a great success. Here is the recipe, which is a trivial modification of one that appears in Nigel Slater&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Real Food&amp;rdquo; (Amazon links: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Real-Food-Nigel-Slater/dp/1841151440/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1382362805&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=nigel+slater+real+food&#34;&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Real-Food-Nigel-Slater/dp/1841151440/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1382362827&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=nigel+slater+real+food&#34;&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;). &amp;ldquo;Real Food&amp;rdquo; is a cookbook that I genuinely treasure. The modification I have made for this recipe is to omit the espresso but I will point out where it should be added, in case you want to give that a try.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have mixed feelings about this show. On the one hand, I like that there are depictions of working class Britain on display and I feel that it is right that these paintings are considered part of the British cultural canon. I also like that a lot of these paintings represent large gatherings of people, which are absent from a lot of what we might call the mainstream of art.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;previously-on&#34;&gt;Previously on&amp;hellip;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I planned this post as a follow-up to one called &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/the-truth-about-work/&#34;&gt;The Truth About Work&lt;/a&gt; from a couple of months ago, but a few things happened that changed my thinking. It has implications for my future and in particular, it redefines what this break from work and upcoming trip means to me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the punchlines to &amp;ldquo;The Truth About Work&amp;rdquo; was that, sometimes, the only way to move ahead is to quit. I originally put it a little more baldly: I said that you &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; have to quit in order to move on from a sticky situation. Because I knew I was about to quit, I felt I had to write about that decision in unequivocal terms. Obviously I don&amp;rsquo;t think that you should just tap out every single time that things get a little tough. I am not even sure now whether I should have done it at all: hitting the reset button so far in advance of the tour no longer feels like the great idea that it once did. I wasted a lot of the last six weeks and the principal effect of that has been to erode my self-esteem and my bank account.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Art Under Attack at Tate Britain</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/art-under-attack-at-tate-britain/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I went with a friend to see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/art-under-attack-histories-british-iconoclasm&#34;&gt;Tate Britain&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Art Under Attack&amp;rdquo; show&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting, if uneven, affair that entertains but doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite succeed in everything it attempts to do. The big word that you learn is iconoclasm: the act of attacking an object believed to represent particular beliefs. The show splits into two parts: ideological acts of iconoclasm committed against works of art in Britain and the work of British artists who embrace iconoclasm as a means for making art. The first half (comprising more than half of the show - because I lump together two of the shows sections &amp;ldquo;Religion&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Politics&amp;rdquo; into this half) is more interesting and successful than the second (&amp;ldquo;Aesthetics&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a few false starts I managed to finish &amp;ldquo;High-Rise&amp;rdquo;, the next in &lt;a href=&#34;j-g-ballard&#34;&gt;my collection of JG Ballard novels&lt;/a&gt;. For a book that I had trouble getting into, it turned out to be a pretty good read - even if it was also a pretty unpleasant one. Published in 1975, &amp;ldquo;High-Rise&amp;rdquo; is perhaps ahead of its time in exploring the effects of social breakdown in stylised and artificial situations where people are in close contact. You might think the plot, about a luxury high-rise that goes to hell, is in some way political or sociological but it really isn&amp;rsquo;t. It&amp;rsquo;s just a big playground in which Ballard throws around some of his most twisted ideas, all the while remarking on the very artifice of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

To be fair, I did notice how awesome they were at the opening ceremony of the Olympics last year, and I have liked the odd one or two of their singles, but up until now I haven&amp;rsquo;t really wanted to listen to any of their albums. In fact before &amp;ldquo;AM&amp;rdquo;, I already had two (ripped from the CDs of friends) but had never bothered to listen to them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understated Classics #25: Long Gone Before Daylight by The Cardigans</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The single biggest fact of life is that you are always going to be alone, you just might not realise it. Listening to The Cardigans&amp;rsquo; excellent 2003 &amp;ldquo;Long Gone Before Daylight&amp;rdquo; will help you see that all our relationships are essentially screwed &amp;ndash; but at least it sounds great while it does so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Long Gone Before Daylight&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;Long Gone Before Daylight&amp;rdquo;) plays the role of &amp;ldquo;The Empire Strikes Back&amp;rdquo; in a trilogy of great albums that The Cardigans released between 1999 (the arguably better and slightly happier &amp;ldquo;Gran Turismo&amp;rdquo;) and 2006 (the unarguably inferior and definitely happier &amp;ldquo;Super Extra Gravity&amp;rdquo;). &amp;ldquo;Long Gone Before Daylight&amp;rdquo; has more of a country sound than &amp;ldquo;Gran Turismo&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Super Extra Gravity&amp;rdquo;, which meant that I ignored it for a long time: until the disintegration and failure of several relationships convinced me of its brilliance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ellen Gallagher is an American artist and her &amp;ldquo;AxME&amp;rdquo; show recently finished at the Tate Modern. I went along a few weeks ago and have only now had a bit of time to write up my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My biggest regret is that I didn&amp;rsquo;t go along to it sooner, so that I had a chance to see it more than once. It was certainly a larger show than I was expecting (it was about the size of the &lt;a href=&#34;ibrahim-el-salahi-at-tate-modern&#34;&gt;Ibrahim El-salahi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;choucair-at-tate-modern&#34;&gt;Saloua Choucair&lt;/a&gt; shows put together) and I hadn&amp;rsquo;t left myself with a lot of time to see everything when I did go.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For reasons that will become apparent, there will be a short period soon where I will not be writing album digests. Until then, I&amp;rsquo;m clearing a backlog of some albums that I&amp;rsquo;ve been listening to but haven&amp;rsquo;t had enough time or motivation to write about. Only one of this month&amp;rsquo;s albums was released this month, something that&amp;rsquo;s not that uncommon at this time of the year as it is not the best time to release things. Here&amp;rsquo;s the list:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation-and-lies&#34;&gt;Motivation and Lies&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Motivation is a fickle thing. You can see it in action here on this blog, or rather in inaction as there are often &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/articles/the-drought/&#34;&gt;droughts&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; between posts (and draughts between drafts&amp;hellip;). Back in June I tried to write a post each day that had a title of the form &amp;ldquo;X and Y&amp;rdquo;. I was overambitious and they petered out after a bit. This was one of those posts and was originally titled &amp;ldquo;Motivation and Lies&amp;rdquo; in melodramatic fashion. I came back to the original draft this evening and quite liked it; so I rewrote the introduction, cut out some of the swears, and rounded out the conclusion a bit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2005, towards the end of the second year of my PhD I presented a poster at a conference in Dresden, Germany. My eccentric colleagues and I stayed on a huge canal boat moored on the Elbe for no discernible reason other than it seemed like a laugh at the time. In reality I was the second worst snorer of the three of us and it also turned out that our room was right underneath the gang-plank and every morning at six the person who made breakfast would stomp across it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s so good that I paid to see it twice! There, that&amp;rsquo;s the review done.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Despicable Me 2&lt;/em&gt; is great for so many reasons. I reckon pretty much anyone aged from 3 to 103 would enjoy both movies&amp;rsquo; warm heartedness and most will love the minions&amp;rsquo; riot of anarchic slapstick. And if they don&amp;rsquo;t, I guess they aren&amp;rsquo;t our kind of people anyway, right?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are a few good reasons for loving &amp;ldquo;Despicable Me 2&amp;rdquo; (and actually most of these reasons apply to the original &amp;ldquo;Despicable Me&amp;rdquo;):&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another four albums for you this month. Sometimes the problem is not finding albums to listen to but actually finding time to listen to them! Often it is not because I don&amp;rsquo;t have time but because I have already found some great albums this month and I am busy listening to those instead. As a result, a couple of these albums are ones that I have only listened to for a week or so, but they are interesting enough to write about. Here are the four albums I am going to write about this month:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Ocean At The End Of The Lane&amp;rdquo; is the new novel by Neil Gaiman. I was so intrigued by it that I bought the hardcover, which is unusual for me because I prefer paperbacks. I&amp;rsquo;d been excited by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/10/extract-ocean-end-lane-neil-gaiman&#34;&gt;reading the first chapter online at the Guardian website&lt;/a&gt; and from reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://amandapalmer.net/blog/20130618/&#34;&gt;a blog post about the novel written by the author&amp;rsquo;s wife Amanda Palmer&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;d not read any of his novels before but they had long been on that &amp;ldquo;to read&amp;rdquo; list that is typically as long as your arm. I also enjoyed the movie adaptation of &amp;ldquo;Stardust&amp;rdquo; though I have no way (yet!) of knowing whether the film is as good as the original book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I want to see a TV show about great mathematicians of the past on a channel like BBC Four. Programmes about mathematics tend to be rather condescending, at least to anyone who has a bit of mathematical knowledge. Perhaps a way around this is to delve into the social and historical circumstances of the great mathematicians and how that along with their personality produced the mathematical results for which they are famous.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/ibrahim-el-salahi-at-tate-modern/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ibrahim El-Salahi is a modernist artist from Sudan. I believe this exhibition is a first for an African artist at the Tate Modern. Much like &lt;a href=&#34;choucair-at-tate-modern&#34;&gt;the Choucair show&lt;/a&gt; (which is still on everyone!), it&amp;rsquo;s an engaging but too short introduction to an interesting artist that you have probably never heard of.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The pieces are roughly divided between large blank and white ink drawings that are mounted on multiple panels and oil paintings in earthy colours that depict abstract scenes. There are one or two pieces that buck this trend, such as &amp;ldquo;Portrait of Mrs. McKelvey&amp;rdquo; and a couple of other portraits toward the beginning of the exhibition. Frustratingly, pictures of his work are rather hard to come by online and the only two works that I was able to surreptitiously snap while at the show were the mesmeric &amp;ldquo;Reborn Sounds of Childhood Dreams I&amp;rdquo; and the mirage-like &amp;ldquo;They Always Appear&amp;rdquo;. (2020 Update: I have removed some images from posts, these being two of them.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There were no mornings or afternoons. It was one seamless day, every day, until the sun began to arc and fade, mountains emerging from their silhouettes. This is when we sat and watched in silence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today I finished reading &amp;ldquo;Point Omega&amp;rdquo; by Don Delillo. I have wanted to read one of his novels for a while and though this is a slip of a novella, I certainly enjoyed it. I accidentally came across it when I looked at the wikpedia page for &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teilhard_de_Chardin&#34;&gt;Pierre Teilhard de Chardin&lt;/a&gt; last week as part of research for another post that I am writing. &amp;ldquo;Point Omega&amp;rdquo; seemed short and in keeping with what I wanted to write about, so I used my usual quick-draw finger on amazon and bought the thing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I read “Skios” by &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Frayn&#34;&gt;Michael Frayn&lt;/a&gt; (who was born in Mill Hill). It’s another book from now customary pile of books that tends to develop around this time of year. &lt;a href=&#34;hawksmoor&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hawksmoor&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;the-marriage-plot&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Marriage Plot&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; were on the same ever-increasing pile. “Skios” is something of a change from what I normally read: it’s a comedic farce about stolen identities set on the (fictional) titular Greek island. Amusingly, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skios&#34;&gt;the wikipedia page for the novel&lt;/a&gt; currently reads “Praise for Skios was entirely misplaced”, probably thanks to some curmudgeon who doesn&amp;rsquo;t like the novel. Cue a ‘misplaced’ blog post about it, something that most people would consider to be business as usual for my blog.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just two albums this month as I am still enjoying last month&amp;rsquo;s albums so much (and I spent loads of time getting reacquainted with Boards Of Canada at the start of the month). I listened to a few more albums but not often enough to write loads about them so there is an &amp;ldquo;honourable mention&amp;rdquo; section at the end of the post that briefly discusses a few more albums.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, the two albums are:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Peter Ackroyd&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Hawksmoor&amp;rdquo; was first published in 1985. I bought a recent reissue that forms part of Penguin&amp;rsquo;s decades collection whilst on a spree in Waterstone&amp;rsquo;s. It appealed to me as I recently realised that despite growing up in the eighties and nineties, I had read very novels that were either written or set in the eighties. Happily &amp;ldquo;Hawksmoor&amp;rdquo; is both of these, sort of. It also appealed to me because it is (again, sort of) a detective story and I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself getting into those lately. John Squire&amp;rsquo;s excellent artwork for the cover and the nice binding also helped to seal the deal: you don&amp;rsquo;t get that with an iPad or a Kindle.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have written a lot in these posts about how music gets indelibly tied up with places, events and feelings. For me this album by Fanfarlo is tied up with all three of these. It makes me happy and sad at the same time in memory of great times that are now gone but are fondly remembered. I am aware that this is the youngest album on the list so far and so it might be a bit early to endow classic status upon it, but &amp;ldquo;Reservoir&amp;rdquo; is a fine album and to my ears it stands up really well. Listening to it again in the course of writing this post I found that I remembered every note and musical phrase, and yet somehow I also managed to delight in hearing new features in the production that I&amp;rsquo;d not noticed before.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I went to see the new Superman reboot &lt;em&gt;Man of Steel&lt;/em&gt; with friends. I really enjoyed it, particularly the more reflective take on the superhero myth. Starting out with the fate of the planet Krypton, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0770828/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Man of Steel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; approximately fuses the events of both the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078346/?ref_=sr_2&#34;&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081573/&#34;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; original Superman movies. We get to see Superman&amp;rsquo;s arrival and childhood on earth and then the arrival of Zod, a maniac bent on replacing the earth and everyone on it with a new race of Kryptonians.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This album sees them back with more of the same: taking the approach that if it ain&amp;rsquo;t broke, don&amp;rsquo;t fix it. There are very few changes to the formula apart from the fact that the spoken word samples are not quite as good this time and there&amp;rsquo;s a bit more Grails-like guitar solo action.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve been to the RA but I was emboldened by my art pass and the fact that Bellows was a contemporary of Edward Hopper, a painter whom I admire greatly. This is the first major retrospective of Bellows&amp;rsquo; work in the UK and taking in his wonderful paintings this afternoon, I felt a little embarrassed that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen anything of his before.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I went to see the Saloua Raouda Choucair show at the Tate Modern. As it was quite small, I went to see &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/lichtenstein-at-tate-modern/&#34;&gt;the Lichtenstein show&lt;/a&gt; again as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Choucair is an underrated Lebanese artist and many of the paintings and sculptures shown were created in the fifties and sixties. Her sculptures in particular are amazing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first room is lined with paintings that were nearly all gouache on paper, about 40cm by 30cm. These paintings were vibrant and abstract. I prefer larger oil paintings and it took me a while to get to grips with the small format and the bright colours, but they are really quite wonderful: the colours swim and dance in front of you. I thought the nudes were particularly interesting, mainly because nudes are executed by almost every artist at some stage (there are some rather spotty ones by Lichtenstein for example) and are usually quite memorable &amp;ndash; so seeing an artist&amp;rsquo;s nudes can give you a point of relation to other artists. Choucair&amp;rsquo;s nudes are pink and ample and altogether the more charming for it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was quite hard to choose an 808 State album for the &lt;a href=&#34;understated-classics&#34;&gt;understated classics series&lt;/a&gt; for two reasons. The first is that I was introduced to 808 State quite late through a friend&amp;rsquo;s sister&amp;rsquo;s cassette copy of The Shamen&amp;rsquo;s En-Tact (the original version recorded from vinyl that had a thirteen minute version of &amp;ldquo;Evil Is Eden&amp;rdquo;) that also had &amp;ndash; to fill out the C90 &amp;ndash; the full length sweary version of &amp;ldquo;What Time Is Love?&amp;rdquo; by The KLF and four tracks: &amp;ldquo;Cubik&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Pacific&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Olympic&amp;rdquo; (I think&amp;hellip;), and &amp;ldquo;In Yer Face&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was a show that I had put off going to see for quite a while now. Looking online at the pictures featured in the show did not really excite me enough to get out and see it. I&amp;rsquo;d seen &lt;em&gt;Whaam!&lt;/em&gt; before in isolation (it&amp;rsquo;s part of the Tate collection and will no doubt return once the retrospective show is over) and it didn&amp;rsquo;t really grab me, arresting as it is. However, with plenty of free time this week it was an ideal time to go see it and I was happy to be proved wrong.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/the-marriage-plot/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Marriage Plot&amp;rdquo; by Jeffrey Eugenides is a novel about love and growing up set in the privileged world of US academia in the early eighties. The main plot concerns a love triangle involving two guys and a girl. Madeline Hanna, the girl at the apex of the love triangle, is the main focus of the novel and the majority of the novel is told from her standpoint. I think her sections are incredibly well written but I&amp;rsquo;d love the thoughts of a female reader, in case it is actually all a horribly male way of seeing through a young woman&amp;rsquo;s eyes. In love with Madeline (and the guy that we meet first) is Mitchell Grammaticus, an overly deep guy who is terribly concerned about whether he is doing the right thing in the world. He thinks that religious studies is for him but later finds that it is harder to live up to your ideals than you first imagine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I saw &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Into Darkness&lt;/em&gt; last night in 3D at the IMAX in Waterloo. I am going to have to separate this into a review into two parts, a review of the film and a review of the viewing experience. I am not completely happy with how the film experience is changed by the 3D and the super big screen and I will try to explain what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The irony being that I used &lt;em&gt;Embryonic&lt;/em&gt; to deal with a break-up and &lt;em&gt;The Terror&lt;/em&gt; is pretty much about&amp;hellip; a break-up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just the David Bowie album this month as it’s pretty much the only new music that I’ve listened to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I must admit that I had no idea what to expect of “The Next Day”. It comes almost exactly ten years after “Reality”, an album that I have never really got into despite it having some pretty decent fun tracks like “New Killer Star” and a nice cover of “Pablo Picasso” that has never sent me in search of Jonathan Richman’s original.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A while back, I decided I was going to write about the Iain M. Banks sci-fi-novels (mainly as a respite from having to read and write about &lt;a href=&#34;j-g-ballard&#34;&gt;J. G. Ballard novels&lt;/a&gt;, but I only got as fas as writing about the excellent “Against A Dark Barkground” and re-reading the first of the Culture novels “Consider Phlebas”. WARNING: Some plot spoilers follow (but not too many).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure why it has taken almost two years to write about this novel. Perhaps it is because I couldn’t find myself a proper explanation for the title. The following is my own theory, feel free to add your own in the comments. The book takes its name from the epigraph, an extract from T.S. Elliot’s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bartleby.com/201/1.html&#34;&gt;“The Waste Land”&lt;/a&gt; (which is also on my “to read” list):&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understated Classics #22: Walking With Thee by Clinic</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“Walking With Thee” is the second album by Liverpool band &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic_(band)&#34;&gt;Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. It was released in 2002, which seems like an age ago now. Even longer ago they released the single “The Return of Evil Bill”, which was got me interested in them in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recently got back into “Walking With Thee” when I picked “Vulture” in my A-Z of Animals playlist last month. I’d forgotten just how great a song it is, both musically and lyrically. It’s a caution against letting those with more power and wealth lord it over us – viz, “the best that you’ve left here for others / is the best the rest of us know” – and so it’s surely much more a song for these times than back then in 2002. Anyway, I’m going to avoid too much reading into the lyrics for this particular understated classic, as most of the time Clinic are defiantly resistant to that kind of analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have had a lot of ideas for posts swirling around in my head in recent days. This is because I have actually done quite a lot of cool things in that time, and because I have hung out with some great people who make me think, and because I always have a whole load of things bouncing around in there anyway - space junk of the mind. I was thinking about how to put together these thoughts I have been having about art and about stories and yes, about love too. It all kind of got muddled up and then I saw it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most Februaries are quite quiet when it comes to albums (though this was not the case &lt;a href=&#34;album-digest-february-2011&#34;&gt;back in 2011&lt;/a&gt;) and although only the Foals album is a major release, I was quite surprised to find myself with four decent albums to write about. They are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Darkstar &amp;ldquo;News From Nowhere&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Foals &amp;ldquo;Holy Fire&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Daniel Hope &amp;ldquo;Spheres&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Apparat &amp;ldquo;Krieg und Frieden (Music For Theatre)&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;darkstar-news-from-nowhere&#34;&gt;Darkstar &amp;ldquo;News From Nowhere&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t need to give too much biographical background for the Darkstar album as I don&amp;rsquo;t know too much about who the are. I saw this album and its lovely artwork in an e-mail from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bleep.com/&#34;&gt;bleep.com&lt;/a&gt;. Because it was on Spotify, I gave it a go. At first I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too impressed but over repeated listens, it has become my favourite album of the month.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The existence, or impending existence, of a new novel by &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Pynchon&#34;&gt;Thomas Pynchon&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=&#34;http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/02/25/pynchon-takes-on-silicon-alley/&#34;&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt;. I have all his previous books (seven written over a period of about fifty years, a pace that I definitely approve of), though he’s a hard author to get close to: I’ve only finished three and started four up till now. The unfinished one is, of course, Gravity’s Rainbow (GR) and somewhat perversely, I have two copies of the thing. Of the three unstarted, both Mason &amp;amp; Dixon (MD) and Against The Day (ATD) seem too dense and intimidating, while Vineland just begs me to read The Crying Of Lot 49 (L49) or Inherent Vice (IV) one more time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The other weekend, beset by insomnia, I decided to follow &lt;a href=&#34;five-things-to-try-when-you-cant-sleep&#34;&gt;my own advice&lt;/a&gt; and get up to do something instead of wallowing unable to sleep. I pulled my emergency jigsaw out of the cupboard and set to it. I should stress that I mean a jigsaw puzzle and not an actually jigsaw: DIY at 2am is not such a good idea!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d forgotten how interesting jigsaw puzzles actually are. As I sat there contemplating the 1000 pieces and wondered exactly what I&amp;rsquo;d let myself in for, I found myself thinking about a number of things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Only one of this month three albums was actually released this month. Nelly Furtado&amp;rsquo;s Mi plan was actually released over three years ago - I only discovered it last year when I wrote &lt;a href=&#34;album-digest-september-2012&#34;&gt;the September album digest&lt;/a&gt; following the release of &amp;ldquo;The Spirit Indestructible&amp;rdquo;, or it might have been when I wrote about &lt;a href=&#34;uc20&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Folklore&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; at around the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I guess these are albums that I bought with my Christmas gift vouchers!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Three albums (one very Christmassey one!) and an EP this month.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tracey Thorn “Tinsel and Lights”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Woob “Have Landed”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tim Hecker and Daniel Lopatin “Instrumental Tourist”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Burial “Truant / Rough Sleeper&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;tracey-thorn-tinsel-and-lights&#34;&gt;Tracey Thorn “Tinsel and Lights”&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Tinsel and Lights” is that rarest of records, a Christmas record that is perfectly suited to the season and is not in any way overbearing or irritating. Most albums that are Christmas themed are usually centred on lots of covers that are taken from a small subset of well worn classics. The songs on “Tinsel And Lights” are either originals or slightly more obscure covers and this works to its great advantage. The most famous song here (“Have yourself a merry little Christmas” aside) is probably the White Stripes’ “In The Cold Cold Night” and that’s not really a Christmas song (though it works better here than I’d anticipated).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pretty much a sliding scale between songs and electronic wibble on this month’s albums and a particularly damp, chilly feeling to proceedings too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bat For Lashes “The Haunted Man”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ital “Hive Mind” and “Dream On”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Björk “Bastards”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Brian Eno “Lux”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;bat-for-lashes-the-haunted-man&#34;&gt;Bat For Lashes “The Haunted Man”&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to Bat For Lashes, I prefer her first album “Fur And Gold” to her second “Two Suns” because when I listen to the latter I don’t feel connected to any of the songs. For me, “Fur And Gold” remains a wonderful adventure throughout, it’s a fantastic listen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A cat reaches the top of a mountain after a long climb through the snow. He is cold from the bottom of his fur to the tips of his claws. He is sodden and wet, and we all know how much a cat hates to be wet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the top of the mountain there is not much to see. What may have been a breathtaking view is instead a murk of freezing mist and at any rate, snow assails the cat’s eyes and whiskers. He shivers and sneezes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The second Woob album (AKA “Woob 4495”) is probably the greatest ambient album ever made and is certainly the best one you have never heard of. Originally released in 1995 &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.emit.cc&#34;&gt;on the em:t label&lt;/a&gt; it is also a rare record. I don’t have an actual copy but I have seen one! I downloaded it off the internet and even that is quite difficult to do. My friend is an avid collector of all the em:t releases and it is easy to see why: all the albums are titled in a specific way that is very appealing to people who like to collect things and they also have very striking nature photography on the covers. In a strange way, the label was able to create an identity for its releases in a way that many artists would try to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, when I am feeling a bit down, I like to write down some of my ambitions. As you can see from this list they are mostly pretty humble but they are also a bit cheesy and embarassing, so I have put them after the fold!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Be wholehearted, cheerful, and sincere&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Be creative&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Look at the world and see its many faces, hear its many voices&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Explore new recipes as often as possible when I cook&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Learn to like the taste of tomatoes and cucumbers&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Be more at ease around people&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Listen to people and hear what they say&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Play my part&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Look after someone special&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Become a parent&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Share my values with others, help those who need it&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Break up all the negative things inside me&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Know what other people want, help them get it&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When I wake up each morning I would like to remember my dreams&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Understand art more than I do&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lose my fear of creepy crawlies&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Learn to drive&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Learn to write left handed (why not?)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Visit every country in Europe&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Visit the radio telescopes on Mauna Kea in Hawaii&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Let go of unnecessary things&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ditch social networks and the rest of the internet as much as possible&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Learn to appreciate the noise around me&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Meditate&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Get over my reliance on sugar to improve my mood&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Get rid of things I don’t need&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Grow the garden&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Write people letters&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Learn the differences between species of trees&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Be flexible and adaptable and positive about the future&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Learn how to hang a picture on a wall&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, two short reviews in a row. I had the day off work and went to see “Rust And Bone” this afternooon. It’s the new film by Jacques Audiard, who directed “A Prophet” – one of my favourite films of the last five years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Rust And Bone” is a love story about Ali, a sexually feckless security guard who is struggling to look after his young son on his own, and Stéphanie (played by second most beautiful woman in the world, Marion Cotillard), who is injured while working as a co-ordinator of killer whale displays at an ocenarium. Needless to say it is not a minor injury. The film is basically their love story. I don’t feel so much responsibility to hide plot details about this film because, to be frank, I could type out the whole plot here and it wouldn’t convey the reasons why it’s so great.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I went to see &amp;ldquo;Skyfall&amp;rdquo; last night and I really enjoyed it. I knew nothing about the plot, mostly because I had avoided all discussion of the plot with people who had already seen it and I even avoided reviews as so many these days seem to just rattle off plot points, instead of discussing what makes the movie any good. With that in mind I will obviously try not to give away any of the plot in this brief review.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a strange month and I found that I didn’t listen to a lot of new music. I have been a bit down and when that’s the case I tend to take refuge in music that I know well, stuff that cheers me up. I have listened to last month’s fave a lot, Nelly Furtado’s “The Spirit Indestructible”. I said a lot of nice things about it but it probably didn’t come over in my writing just how much I really liked it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight, despite feeling a bit under the weather, I went to Stevenage to watch Portsmouth play a League One game at the Lamex Stadium. In addition, I met a “person off the internet” for the second time in a week – this time Tom, a friend of a friend from Facebook: our shared passions being Portsmouth FC and really cool music. We met at King’s Cross and caught a packed train to Stevenage, a non-descript dormitory town that was even more non-descript than I remember St Albans being. I’m glad I went, even though Pompey lost. It’s funny how sitting in a shed in the cold watching your team lose counts as entertainment!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is another mathematics post that does not actually feature any equations or graphs. It is intended to set the way clear for writing regularly about nonlinear systems. This in itself is a precursor to writing more about mathematical biology as biological systems are inherently complex and nonlinear. I am reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Nonlinear-Systems-Cambridge-Applied-Mathematics/dp/0521406684/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1349212296&amp;amp;sr=8-1&#34;&gt;P. G. Drazin’s textbook on Nonlinear Systems&lt;/a&gt; and this post is a glossary of terms from the start of the book laid down here because I wanted to remember how to typeset &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_dl.asp&#34;&gt;definition lists&lt;/a&gt; in Markdown (though in the end I (ab)used &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;h4&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags because it looked better).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a bit more time to listen to this month’s albums because I was on holiday for two weeks. I didn’t manage to write about them while on holiday though! In fact I bought and listened to a few more, but I will save them for next month. The albums I will discuss now (in order bought) are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Four Tet “Pink”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The xx “Coexist”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Nelly Furtado “The Spirit Indestructible”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Grizzly Bear “Shields”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s quite a diverse collection and, Four Tet apart, quite song based.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over my holiday I read &amp;ldquo;Even The Dogs&amp;rdquo; by Jon McGregor. I&amp;rsquo;ve not quite finished it yet but that will at least prevent me from giving away spoilers. I am not sure I would want to give any spoilers anyway because it is unrelentingly grim so far. Perhaps there is a happy  ending but both you and I will have to read it to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was introduced to Jon McGregor by the book group I was part of during my PhD. I think &amp;ldquo;If Nobody Speaks Of Remarkable Things&amp;rdquo; was the first book I read for the group. At that time of my life, about eight or so years after finishing my English Literature A-level, I had not had to read a book that I had not chosen for myself for quite a long time. I found it to be a complete shock. I can still remember reading about half that book straight out of the amazon packaging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although I have put off finishing &lt;a href=&#34;programming-an-uno-game&#34;&gt;my UNO game&lt;/a&gt; for over eighteen months, I thought I would get started with another pet project of mine: making a Carcassonne game. This is not a serious affair, there is an excellent app of Carcassonne available for those of you who have iOS devices (it works particularly well on the iPad). The game just strikes me as having the right level of complexity to be a taxing yet attainable project. I’d also like to understand strategies for playing the game and what better way to evaluate strategies for games of chance than to have a simulator to play all those millions of games that you don’t have time to play?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s rather spooky but shortly after deciding to write about Nelly Furtado’s “Folklore” as the next &lt;a href=&#34;understated-classics&#34;&gt;understated classic&lt;/a&gt;, I found out that she has a new album out this week. As a result, I have been listening to a lot of her music while writing this post, and I’ve been enjoying it too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As always with these choices of mine, “Folklore” is a record that I can link to particular events and emotions in my life and so I guess my perception of it is coloured by that. Nevertheless while re-listening to the album I tried to examine whether my feelings for it were &lt;em&gt;entirely&lt;/em&gt; centred on those memories and emotional responses. I think the answer is not a simple one, because in recent weeks I’ve felt very unsettled in many aspects of my life and so I probably have found it difficult to tell.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Album Digest August 2012 is also from the stack of albums that I &lt;a href=&#34;album-digest-july-2012&#34;&gt;mentioned last month&lt;/a&gt;. I chose this selection (along with the Passion Pit album) because the colours looked good together in the mosaic of covers that I make each month. Last month’s digest was about the right amount of detail so this will be another briefer digest. These are all good albums but not ones that will change your life, they&amp;rsquo;ll just happily sit alongside it. They are:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“The Gone-Away World” is a novel by Nick Harkaway. It’s about a world slightly askew to our own in which the powers-that-be have deigned to unleash a weapon that simply wipes the enemy out of existence. Unfortunately the enemies also have the same weapon and there are terrible consequences to the extent that the very fabric of reality is threatened. If you don’t already know what reification means, you will by the end.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“I see the people working and see it working for them.” (&lt;em&gt;Sat In Your Lap&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Dreaming by Kate Bush is a strange 1982 album that many believed had destroyed her career. Two weeks before her first ever performance of “Running Up That Hill”, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nme.com/blog/index.php?blog=10&amp;amp;title=on_this_day_kate_bush_releases_hounds_of_1986&amp;amp;more=1&amp;amp;c=1&amp;amp;tb=1&amp;amp;pb=1&#34;&gt;the NME had written an editorial asking whether she had burnt herself out completely&lt;/a&gt;. Obviously “Running Up That Hill” (recently used to great effect in the Olympic Closing Ceremony) and the parent album “The Hounds Of Love” that followed showed that she had plenty more up her sleeve.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a short album digest this month. I bought a stack of CDs and am parcelling them out over the next few months (together with important additional releases as they crop up). This is in the hope that I can write more considered pieces about each one. This month I’ve grouped together albums with monochrome covers and a BT album from June that I found out about recently. These albums are not just linked by their artwork, they also form a cohesive whole. As a result I dispense with reviewing each album in depth. As usual there is a playlist at the end.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Three fantastic albums for Album Digest June 2012:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Saint Etienne &lt;em&gt;Words and Music by Saint Etienne&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Liars &lt;em&gt;WIXIW&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Hot Chip &lt;em&gt;In Our Heads&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This month is a curious selection in that the albums are all by bands that I already own a few records by. When there is so much other directly related material that you can write about, it makes focussing on the album in hand quite difficult. I am always thinking up rankings and comparisons. Where does this new album fit in with the rest of them? Will I like it as much when the novelty wears off? What would it sound like if they had done Y or Z like they did back on album X?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is about the films of Wes Anderson. I am no expert, I’ve just watched them all recently (inspired by &lt;a href=&#34;moonrise-kingdom-a-short-review&#34;&gt;seeing “Moonrise Kingdom”&lt;/a&gt;) and spotted a some similarities and differences between the films and I thought it would be fun to write about them. My appearance on Mastermind with “The Films of Wes Anderson” as my specialist subject will have to wait for now. Feel free to add to the discussion in the comments. In case you don’t know what the films are, here they are in order (with links to their IMDB pages):&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;../../assets/images/other/June-2012-Bookstack.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;More books to add to the “University of life” course list&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More books to add to the “University of life” course list. From top to bottom: I picked up “Generation X” for 50p in a charity shop in Tintagel. “Everything Is Going To Be OK” is a picture book full of inspirational mottos. “The Happiness Hypothesis” is the most useful and interesting book that I have read in a long while. I decided to read “How To Write A Sentence” as an alternative to Strunk and White’s “The Elements Of Style” which, while useful, can be a little stuffy! “The Marriage Plot” is a novel with interesting reviews, it was also (ahem) well-priced. After love I decided to go after music as something else I wanted to read about, hence “The Music Instinct” which comes highly recommended. “The Gifts Of Imperfection” is a manifesto for embracing life in a wholehearted way. And “Gonzo”? Well, &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/gonzo-a-graphic-biography-of-hunter-s-thompson/&#34;&gt;I have written about that one already&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As indicated by my &lt;a href=&#34;articles/reading-list-mid-april-2012&#34;&gt;reading list&lt;/a&gt; posted a couple of months ago (which has since been added to &lt;a href=&#34;articles/another-reading-list&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), I’ve started to try to read more about the things that I felt that I did not understand so well. Most notably perhaps is this book “on love” by Helen Fisher. Lest there is any innuendo it is not a book about technique nor does it attempt to explain love to those who have never known it, instead it assumes that we have all been there. In fact, the book attempts to explain the neurological mechanisms of love (specifically romantic love) and describes how science has helped reveal these mechanisms to us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This arrived on Monday and I thought I would give it a post of its own because at over 3 hours of music, I am unlikely to do more than dip into it before writing the album digest next week. It is a far bigger and more enjoyable artefact than I thought it was going to be, so it probably deserves special attention for that reason too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_(band)&#34;&gt;CAN&lt;/a&gt; are a German (“&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krautrock&#34;&gt;Krautrock&lt;/a&gt;”) band that I got into about four years ago after my interest in the genre was sparked by the “Neu! 75” album and the Kraftwerk box set. I have four of CAN&amp;rsquo;s albums and I have thought about which one I should include as an &lt;a href=&#34;understated-classics&#34;&gt;understated classic&lt;/a&gt;. It will probably be “Soon Over Babaluma” because no one really writes about that one. Then again, Portishead’s “Third” probably wouldn’t sound as awesome as it does without the influence of “Ege Bamyasi”, so that might be worth considering too. Everyone writes about “Tago Mago” and “Future Days” but for good reason.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another book from the “university of life” pile (though &lt;a href=&#34;reading-list-mid-april-2012&#34;&gt;not in the picture&lt;/a&gt;), “Gonzo” is the biography of Hunter S. Thompson in graphical form. In case you don’t know his work, &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_S._Thompson&#34;&gt;Hunter S. Thompson&lt;/a&gt; was a journalist who invented the so-called “gonzo” style. This was basically to rock up at some major event and become embedded within it, usually writing up a long form piece from an outsider perspective. He was particularly famous for his work on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell%27s_Angels:_The_Strange_and_Terrible_Saga_of_the_Outlaw_Motorcycle_Gangs&#34;&gt;Hell’s Angels&lt;/a&gt; and Richard Nixon’s campaign for presidential re-election in 1972.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight I avoided the first half of the football along with my friend Albert Jan and we went to watch “Moonrise Kingdom” at the wonderful Everyman cinema in Hampstead. It was a real treat in every sense. To start with, the Everyman is a lovely cinema. It is quite expensive but you do get what you pay for: a comfortable seat in a great theatre and the chance to watch more than just the latest blockbusters (though it shows those too). I think it was the only cinema in my area that was showing &lt;em&gt;Moonrise Kingdom&lt;/em&gt;, though it has been out for a while now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Say what? We’re allowing compilations now?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes. Why not? A good mix is as much an artistic statement as a full-blown single artist album. It takes a lot of skill to get from A to B and keep everything on the boil in between. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fabriclondon.com/store/catalog/product/view/id/30/s/fabric-12/categories/8/&#34;&gt;This Fabric mix by The Amalgamation Of Soundz&lt;/a&gt; is one of my favourites because it is a downtempo (but, crucially, not &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; downtempo) compilation delivered with flair and using what I consider to be unconventional sources (soundtracks, tribute albums, hip-hop) to do it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Electronic music is relatively easy to write about: the music is often simple (but not always), there are recognisable structures and genres (but not always), and there are conventions that are adhered to (but not always). The repetition of those parenthetical “not always” means that while the writing is easy, it is also often quite fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A mostly instrumental month with a comeback from Orbital, an excellent remix collection from Battles, an amazing movie documenting a live performance by the Chemical Brothers and Austin Wintory’s soundtrack to the game &lt;em&gt;Journey&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Orbital &lt;em&gt;Wonky&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Battles &lt;em&gt;Dross Glop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Chemical Brothers &lt;em&gt;Don’t Think&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Austin Wintory &lt;em&gt;Journey (Original Soundtrack)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;orbital-wonky&#34;&gt;Orbital &lt;em&gt;Wonky&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am quite keen on Orbital, though perhaps not as keen as I am on the similarly named Orb. I think I have got all the Orbital albums, mostly bought on eBay after the fact. (Funny story though, I did find a copy of &lt;em&gt;In Sides&lt;/em&gt; in the loft of a house where I lived in Bath, along with several other albums…) My favourite Orbital album is probably &lt;em&gt;Snivilisation&lt;/em&gt; but they all have their moments, whether it is the genuine sliver of emotion shot through &lt;em&gt;Halcyon&lt;/em&gt; off the brown album, the proggy long-form tracks on &lt;em&gt;In Sides&lt;/em&gt; like &lt;em&gt;The Girl With The Sun In Her Head&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Out There Somewhere&lt;/em&gt; (parts one and two), or indeed the arsing about with heavy metal samples on tracks like &lt;em&gt;Tension&lt;/em&gt; off the highly underrated &lt;em&gt;The Altogether&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I had this album before &lt;em&gt;Maxinequaye&lt;/em&gt; because back then it wasn’t as easy to go back and catch up with albums that you had missed as it is now. I had bought enough singles to get the postcards through the post that advertised &lt;em&gt;Nearly God&lt;/em&gt; (this, kids, is what we had before e-mail and liking things on Facebook) and when I heard &lt;em&gt;Poems&lt;/em&gt; for the first time on the radio I was incredibly excited.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lonely Londoners&lt;/em&gt; by Sam Selvon was written in 1956 and tells of the experiences of West Indian men moving to London for work. It has been described as the definitive novel about the experiences of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/museum/item.asp?item_id=50&#34;&gt;Windrush settlers&lt;/a&gt;. The narrative centres on a man named Moses who was one of the first to come to London and finds himself the first port of call for many subsequent immigrants:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It look to old Moses that he hardly have time to settle in the old Brit’n before all sorts of fellars start coming straight to his room in the Water when they land up in London from the West Indies, saying that so and so tell them that Moses is a good fellar to contact, that he would help them get place to stay and work to do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I pay to have this blog up and running. That is, I pay for the space where it is stored and I pay for the name. I have to look after all the files and plug-ins, I have to perform all the updates and optimise the database tables. All this is great fun but wouldn’t it be cheaper to slap the mattischro.me address onto a hosted WordPress.com account?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, yes it would. I suppose I just like the independence of having my own little patch of cyberspace, sitting there waiting for all you dear readers to come and visit. Nice ideas don’t make the world go round though and so I need a better reason than that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Five albums for Album Digest March 2012&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fanfarlo &lt;em&gt;Rooms Filled With Light&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Shins &lt;em&gt;Port Of Morrow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Grails &lt;em&gt;Deep Politics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;New Build &lt;em&gt;Yesterday Was Lived And Lost&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Scuba &lt;em&gt;Personality&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A nice collection of albums this month - things usually pick up in March after a slow period after Christmas. One of these is a “catch-up” (the album by Grails) but apart from that one, everything else was released in the last five weeks or so… I should probably have included the album by Racehorses that I bought on my birthday but I will have to leave that for next month as I haven’t listened to it that much. In fact, it is still in my housemate’s car!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;among-fields-of-crystal--wind-in-lonely-fences&#34;&gt;Among Fields of Crystal / Wind in Lonely Fences&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have written about a &lt;a href=&#34;uc4&#34;&gt;fair&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;uc6&#34;&gt;number of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;uc13&#34;&gt;ambient&lt;/a&gt; albums in this series (and there are at least two more to come!) but perhaps none are as unobtrusive as this one by Howard Budd and Brian Eno. It’s a subtle collection of music that sits at the margins of your consciousness: for a long time it was the music that I turned to when I could not sleep but I could just as easily imagine it as (ahem!) romantic background music as I could something to work to. I actually bought it in 2006 to listen to on an overnight flight back from the US.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One EP and three albums for Album Digest February 2012:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Burial &lt;em&gt;Kindred EP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;John Talabot &lt;em&gt;fIN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Lilacs &amp;amp; Champagne &lt;em&gt;Lilacs &amp;amp; Champagne&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The 2 Bears &lt;em&gt;Be Strong&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;album-digest-february-2011&#34;&gt;Last February&lt;/a&gt; was a pretty good month for song based albums, although the likes of Radiohead and James Blake provided plenty of electronic noodling in and around their song structures. (Interestingly, out of the two out-and-out song based albums, one was one of the worst albums of the year and the other one of the best).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;j-g-ballard&#34;&gt;Ages ago&lt;/a&gt; I set out to write a post for each of JG Ballard’s novels. In fact it is the oldest post on this blog. Most of the novels (I don’t have the two autobiographical novels &lt;em&gt;Empire Of The Sun&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Kindness Of Women&lt;/em&gt; and the late period novel &lt;em&gt;Milennium People&lt;/em&gt;) are sat in a row on top of my broken bookshelf, part of the weight there that bowed outer frame of the unit and made the inner shelves collapse. Had I known that it would be a task unfinished nearly eighteen months later and destroy a piece a furniture that I did not yet own, I may have been less ambitious.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Five albums to see in the new year:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;FOE “Bad Dream Hotline”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Leila “U &amp;amp; I”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Diagrams “Black Light”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pyramids &amp;amp; Horseback “A Throne Without A King”&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;FabricLive 61 mixed by Pinch&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;foe-bad-dream-hotline&#34;&gt;FOE &lt;em&gt;Bad Dream Hotline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I listened to “Bad Dream Hotline” about four times thinking “who does her voice remind me of?”. In the end I realised it was Sophie Ellis-Bextor, though in parts she sounds like KT Tunstall too. Of course these are rather tame references and I don’t mean to damn with faint praise, this album is much more edgy than those two ever were. If you are after some girly power pop with a darker edge then this will no doubt be the album that you have been waiting for.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understated Classics #15: Début by Björk</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/understated-classics-15/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got into Début via a cassette from the library, much like I did with &lt;a href=&#34;uc1&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Together Alone&lt;/em&gt; by Crowded House&lt;/a&gt;. I suppose it is less obscure than many of my choices for &lt;a href=&#34;understated-classics&#34;&gt;this strand&lt;/a&gt; but I do think that &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; is more well-known (because of &lt;em&gt;It’s Oh So Quiet&lt;/em&gt;, which we shall mention here only briefly) and that &lt;em&gt;Homogenic&lt;/em&gt; is probably more popular among her fans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What I really like about &lt;em&gt;Début&lt;/em&gt; though, as much as the album itself, is the panoply of remixes and alternative versions that surround the release. In this way &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; is at least as strong if not stronger and you might recall that I had similar fun &lt;a href=&#34;uc13&#34;&gt;when writing about the Orb’s album U.F.Orb a while back&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of this, there will be some detours into the remixes and live versions when discussing this album. In particular, I will mention the remix collection &lt;em&gt;the best mixes from the album début for all the people who don’t buy white labels&lt;/em&gt; and the recording of an MTV Unplugged show that is available in the &lt;em&gt;Live Box&lt;/em&gt; box set.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time there was a man who loved to paint. He studied the art and craft of painting for many years. He chose to invest his time and energy into creating the most realistic portraits that he could paint. For him the joy came not from completing the paintings but the process of recreating the real world with the strokes of his brush.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For many years he continued to study the art of painting. He learned new techniques for abstracting from reality but he always favoured the realism above all else. Meanwhile, his friends and family mocked him and said that he would always be a poor boy who loved to paint but could not make money from it. He had no answer to this criticism, the satisfaction he gained from applying the brush to the canvas was to great to worry about whether his paintings would be finished or not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dreams Of A Life&lt;/em&gt; is a documentary about Joyce Vincent, a woman who was found in her flat three years after her death surrounded by wrapped christmas presents and with the TV still on. £2400 in arrears on her rent, she was discovered by bailiffs who forced the door down. The film attempts to work out happened to Joyce by interviewing people who knew her. In two other strands that unfold in parallel, various events from her life are re-enacted along with the clearing of her flat by forensics officers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some rather brief pen pictures of this month’s albums. I’ve been a bit busy!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;radio-slave---collected-remixes&#34;&gt;Radio Slave - Collected Remixes&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thud thud thud. This is pretty much how all Radio Slave remixes go. I really liked his fabric mix and borrowed a few tracks for a playlist I made called &amp;ldquo;Dancing In Space&amp;rdquo;. Anyway, back to the thudding: it’s no bad thing, the remixes have a nice formula that works well for discovering new tracks like UNKLE’s &lt;em&gt;Burn My Shadow&lt;/em&gt; (Ian Astbury’s vocal is given plenty of room to shine) and K3’s &lt;em&gt;Play To Win&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My earliest memory is waking up in Queen Alexandra hospital in Cosham after an operation on my ears. I must have been about four years old and it was the middle of the night. I was in a room on my own and the door was locked. It had been daylight only seconds before so I got out of the bed and walked to the window to look incredulously out at the amber world that lay beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just three albums this month as I’ve been listening to a lot of Brian Eno records ready for an upcoming understated classic. First up is &lt;em&gt;50 Words For Snow&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Kate Bush&lt;/strong&gt;, the second album that she has released this year. &lt;a href=&#34;album-digest-may-2011&#34;&gt;Back in May&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about &lt;em&gt;Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt;, which presented re-recorded and re-mastered versions of songs from her albums &lt;em&gt;The Sensual World&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Red Shoes&lt;/em&gt;. This time around it is an album of brand new material, the first since &lt;em&gt;Aerial&lt;/em&gt; in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think it’s time to discuss your philosophy of drug use as it relates to artistic endeavour…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That quote is from the movie “The Naked Lunch” directed by David Cronenburg (see also &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/crash/&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;) and it also opens “Bug Powder Dust” by Bomb The Bass, the five star single that opens “Clear”. A rollicking piece of rock rap dripping with pop culture references that runs for four and half minutes and does not stop until another quote from “The Naked Lunch”, it is probably one of my favourite songs of the 90s. That churning guitar line sends me right back.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There was much excitement about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1598778/&#34;&gt;Contagion&lt;/a&gt; at work. Finally a movie that explains  as part of the plot! A bunch of us went to see it, mainly to see whether &lt;a href=&#34;http://contagionmovie.warnerbros.com/index.html&#34;&gt;a disaster movie about a global pandemic&lt;/a&gt; could hold up as entertainment and to have a bit of a giggle if it couldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I liked three things in particular about the film. I liked the cinematography, especially the opening sequences with the index cases staggering around. I liked the soundtrack except for when it intruded a bit too much into proceedings. Finally, I liked Marion Cotillard, who seems to be in every interesting movie at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/the-philosopher-and-the-wolf/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I saw that a friend had ‘liked’ this book on Facebook and reading about it on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Philosopher-Wolf-Lessons-Death-Happiness/dp/1847081029/&#34;&gt;amazon&lt;/a&gt;, I was curious enough to give it a go. It is the autobiography of the philosopher &lt;a href=&#34;http://rowlands.philospot.com/&#34;&gt;Mark Rowlands&lt;/a&gt;, specifically the experiences and lessons learned from raising a wolf, Brenin, from cub to maturity and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The book addresses different aspects of philosophy including the nature of evil and the interaction between humans and other animals. As you might expect, the book pays particular attention to our interactions with wolves and dogs. There is also a lot of explanation of the difference between wolves and dogs. Rowlands appears often to disparage dogs, though remembering my experiences of our Labradors while growing up did make me nod in agreement quite often.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This month we have albums by Björk, Coldplay, M83, and Radiohead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;album-digest-october-2011---intro&#34;&gt;Album Digest October 2011 - Intro&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I listened to Wilco’s &lt;em&gt;The Whole Love&lt;/em&gt; again the other day. I happened to be walking past the venue in Portsmouth where I went to see them live back in 2004 and it seemed the right fit. I really enjoyed the album after a period of not having listened to it and I found that being familiar with the songs allowed me to better appreciate the production of the album. It really is better than I had said last time when I included it in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/2011/09/album-digest-september-2011/&#34;&gt;September Album Digest&lt;/a&gt;, I suppose that it was the danger in writing about music you have only had with you for a few weeks (or days in the case of &lt;em&gt;The Whole Love&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hmmm, a rather grey looking selection of covers this month. The albums I have listened to most are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;John Beltran &lt;em&gt;Ambient Selections&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;FabricLive 59 mixed by Four Tet&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Rapture &lt;em&gt;In The Grace Of Your Love&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Wilco &lt;em&gt;The Whole Love&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have actually only had the Wilco album since Monday of this week (the 26th) but it has inveigled its way into my consciousness quite quickly. As I have said before, &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/2010/playlist-1-metallic/&#34;&gt;this blog owes its name to a Wilco song&lt;/a&gt; and they are quite an important band to me. The other albums are mostly electronic, although The Rapture are distinctly indie flavoured as they hit the dance floor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Frank Herbert, Dune</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A week or so ago, I finished reading &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; by Frank Herbert. It tells the story of a revolution within a Galactic Empire that takes place on a harsh and unforgiving desert planet called Arrakis. One central theme is how destinies can be shaped despite being intertwined around many axes. Another is the importance of adaptation in the fight for survival.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I came to &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; via the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087182/&#34;&gt;David Lynch film&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert%27s_Dune&#34;&gt;the Sci-Fi Channel’s mini-series&lt;/a&gt;, which I was able to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lovefilm.com/film/Dune-Part-1/161663/&#34;&gt;stream through LoveFilm&lt;/a&gt;. Of the two filmed versions, I found the latter to be more enjoyable and this is almost certainly because it runs to nearly six hours. The 1984 film runs to over 3 hours and yet still feels rather rushed. The Lynch version is to be praised though as in my opinion it develops a unique aesthetic for the Dune universe that I did not detect so much in the book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FUN FACT:&lt;/strong&gt; It was because of the artwork to this album that I obsessively scrawled onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome on my pencil case at school. I also had a very passable u.f.orb logo drawn on it too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-the-blue-room&#34;&gt;In The Blue Room&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had my first “close encounter” with The Orb in 1992 when the single &lt;em&gt;Blue Room&lt;/em&gt; was in the charts. Back then, as I &lt;a href=&#34;uc2&#34;&gt;mentioned previously&lt;/a&gt;, I would listen to the radio a lot and this tune - introduced as the longest single ever to enter the UK chart - struck me as really interesting. The radio edit was a burbling wash of synths and female vocals underpinned by a hefty bass performance from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.newstatesman.com/music/2008/06/wobble-life-music-dub-leaving&#34;&gt;Jah Wobble&lt;/a&gt;. Incidentally, the same week that &lt;em&gt;Blue Room&lt;/em&gt; entered the chart, I was actually listening out for &lt;em&gt;Sentinel&lt;/em&gt; by Mike Oldfield and this single (&lt;a href=&#34;uc10&#34;&gt;from Tubular Bells II&lt;/a&gt;) featured two remixes by The Orb.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I bought a collection of electronic music this month. I mixed them all up in a smart playlist on iTunes, the smart aspect being to limit to tracks that had been played fewer than five then six then seven times etc. This made sure I was still listening to all the tracks equally often, despite the randomness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Biosphere &lt;em&gt;N-plants&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ford &amp;amp; Lopatin &lt;em&gt;Channel Pressure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Gus Gus &lt;em&gt;Arabian Horse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Instra:Mental &lt;em&gt;Resolution 653&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Jon Tejada &lt;em&gt;Parabolas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;biosphere-n-plants&#34;&gt;Biosphere &lt;em&gt;N-Plants&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think this album makes Biosphere the most reviewed musician on this blog at the moment but I don’t mind too much, he makes some great stuff. &lt;em&gt;N-Plants&lt;/em&gt; is a series of pieces about Japanese nuclear power plants and was ready for release by about February this year, just before the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster&#34;&gt;Fukishima nuclear disaster&lt;/a&gt; in March. It ended up being released in June. I am not sure if this represents a delay or not but as this quote shows, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.touchmusic.org.uk/catalogue/to84_biosphere_nplants.html&#34;&gt;Geir Jenssen is aware of how spooky the timing was&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understated Classics #12: Look Sharp! by Roxette</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;happy-birthday&#34;&gt;Happy Birthday!&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No matter how intellectual one gets about these things, the primary function of music is to have fun. With this in mind it is a good time to turn to Roxette then, as they are almost always the epitome of fun.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I received &lt;em&gt;Look Sharp!&lt;/em&gt; as a present for my ninth birthday. This was probably a bit young to fully understand all the emotions expressed on the record. It’s just as well that it is also crammed with the kind of pop confections that made &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Bore_Us,_Get_to_the_Chorus!&#34;&gt;“Don’t bore us, get to the chorus!”&lt;/a&gt; something of a band motto and made for a great introduction to the world of pop for a nine year old boy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Five lessons from a year of blogging</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/five-lessons-from-a-year-of-blogging/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 05 Aug 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/five-lessons-from-a-year-of-blogging/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have now been writing decent length articles on this site for about a year. I have learned a lot in this time, mostly about writing but also how to express your feelings and how to marshal your ideas and passions into action. For this month’s “five on the fifth”, I would like to share  with you some of the things I have learned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing posts consistently is hard…&lt;/strong&gt; There are a lot of things that get in the way of regular posting. Sometimes it is ambition undermines me, I have ideas for posts that are easy to think up that turn out to be much harder to actually write. Other times life does just get in the way, it is  a time-consuming activity to write five hundred or more words every day. I like to write posts out longhand before typing them up. I often find mistakes or horrible phrasing when I do this and often what seemed like a simple matter of typing something up becomes a bit of a mission. Of course, there are times when I am just lazy or uninspired.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;…except when it is easy.&lt;/strong&gt; I discovered early on that having a few arcs through the posts was a good idea as it makes you think a few in advance about what to do next. I prefer to be a generalist but it is nice to have the movie reviews, the &lt;a href=&#34;understated-classics&#34;&gt;understated classics&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;j-g-ballard&#34;&gt;JG Ballard&lt;/a&gt; novels to fall back on. Truth be told I am a little bored of Ballard now but even if I retire that particular strand of posts (Spoiler: Don’t worry, &lt;em&gt;High-Rise&lt;/em&gt; is on the way soon) I can always resume it later. Meanwhile, I can pad out the off days with some quotes or some photos.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easier to read is easier to write.&lt;/strong&gt; I hope that the blog is easier to read now than when I started. I still find myself producing the odd clunky phrase now and then but the number of passive sentences is decreasing. The unexpected benefit of this has been that I find it easier to check earlier posts in search for inspiration about what to write next. Early on, I would often end up editing old posts into something more comprehensible instead of writing new material. The “After the Deadline” feature of &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jetpack/&#34;&gt;Jetpack for WordPress&lt;/a&gt; has been very helpful in training me to write better.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WordPress is a lot of fun.&lt;/strong&gt; The statistic is that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wordpress.org/&#34;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; now powers about 500 million websites. It is not hard to see why, it is easy to install, easy to customise to suit to your tastes and most of all, it rewards you for continuing to produce content. I have installed all sorts of plug-ins, including a &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-word-count/&#34;&gt;word count plug-in&lt;/a&gt; that tells me that I have (up to this post) written a total of 89,032 published words. &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_a_novel&#34;&gt;If Wikipedia is to be believed&lt;/a&gt;, that is about the length of a pretty long novel. At least now I know I could write a novel in a year even if it was a rather surreal one featuring a 10K run, spiders and an Apatosaurus.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I still have a lot more to do, a lot more to learn.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;2017-update&#34;&gt;2017 Update&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Adding to this footnote some years later (2017) I realise that not all blog posts are permanent. Sometimes you write what you need to at the time and then take it down later. We don&amp;rsquo;t have to be permanently changed by what we once wrote on a Wednesday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quite a mixed bag this month.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;SBTRKT &lt;em&gt;SBTRKT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Zomby &lt;em&gt;Dedication&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Brian Eno &lt;em&gt;Drums Between The Bells&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bon Iver &lt;em&gt;Bon Iver&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Washed Out &lt;em&gt;Within and Without&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This month’s collection of albums is a rather mellow bunch. The SBTRKT album (self-titled) is probably the most frenetic of the five though even that does not exactly pound four to the floor. Most of it is pretty calm, though  the occasional burst of pop to spice things up: sometimes it is as downtempo as the rest (&lt;em&gt;Right Thing To Do&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Trials Of The Past&lt;/em&gt;) but at other times things spark into life, as on &lt;em&gt;Pharaohs&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“I read the news today, oh boy”  (The Beatles, &lt;em&gt;A Day In The Life&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes watching the news feels like a series of repeated blows to the face: arbitrary, cruel and unrelenting. It gets draining and upsetting, and leaves you fearful of what might come next.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You won’t need me to tell you about the tragedies that have occurred all over the world in the last few days: drought in East Africa, the gunman running amok in Norway, the death of Amy Winehouse and the horrific train crash in China.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understated Classics #11: Second Toughest In The Infants by Underworld</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;your-rails-your-fins-your-thin-paper-wings&#34;&gt;Your rails, your fins, your thin paper wings&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Second Toughest in the Infants&lt;/em&gt; (STITI) is the second album by Underworld, released in 1995. This was just ahead of the mania caused by the .NUXX version of Born Slippy appearing on the &lt;em&gt;Trainspotting&lt;/em&gt; soundtrack a little later. &lt;em&gt;Born Slippy&lt;/em&gt; itself, the blippy techno confection released between their début &lt;em&gt;Dubnobasswithmyheadman&lt;/em&gt; and this album. STITI then is very much the calm before the storm and features a band (in the truest sense, which is unusual among electronic acts) in full flow. The sure hands are apparent from the off with the all-in-one trifecta of &lt;em&gt;Juanita&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Kiteless&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;To Dream of Love&lt;/em&gt;: a huge slab of a track that propels, mashes and then glides over various tempos in its sixteen minute run.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Beta Test Of Everything</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading a few articles about the recent launch of Google+, a few things hit home. Google tends to launch a product that works and not always one that is perfect or finished (like, say, Apple). Sometimes it takes them several iterations to get right. They love the beta tag. In fact, I think it was Google (or possibly Flickr) that made me aware of the concept of beta software.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Along these line I thought about this blog and its one year anniversary. I take a similar approach here to posts on this blog, specifically in pushing out new categories now and then. I have done this in the hope that adding a new subject or thread will lead to me writing more posts. Currently I am averaging ten posts a month, which is not too bad.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why I Love The Jungle Book</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just as with the &lt;a href=&#34;understated-classics&#34;&gt;understated classics&lt;/a&gt; I want to set out my stall early on that good movies are good enough. Both &lt;a href=&#34;why-i-love-betty-blue&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Betty Blue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and today’s choice &lt;em&gt;The Jungle Book&lt;/em&gt; are never going to win any sort of consensus prize for the best movies ever made but they are really good. They also have a personal history attached that makes them worth writing about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I was younger both my sisters would be given VHS copies of Disney movies at a rate of about two a year, one for Christmas and one at their birthday. It seems strange today to think of that pace of movie acquisition, never mind the clunky VHS cassettes and how they would warp over time. I didn’t really ever get any of the Disney movies myself but I would inevitably find myself watching them with my sisters who would watch them repeatedly. With just four TV channels back then, who could blame us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was growing up a framed print of a map hung on the wall in the hallway. It was one of my favourite things, littered with strange latin names and with Vs where Us should have been. The outlines of the continents and countries were all familiar and yet slightly distorted, becoming more recognisable around the shores of western Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don’t know the provenance of that map print but at some point it got taken to the charity shop and replaced by Van Gogh’s sunflowers. I guess that means that I shall never be able to work out exactly what map it was and when it was from.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have had the sort of month that is not conducive to listening to much new music. Therefore this month’s post is only going to consider two new albums and two albums that I have bought behind time. Because of various bits of stress and poor mood, I have ended up going back and taking refuge in some old favourites and not listening to new stuff. At other points I have also gone back to the Fleet Foxes’ album that I wrote about last month, which has grown on me even more since. Sometimes I think that I should writing about these albums on a two month delay. Meanwhile, I even have new music that I haven’t listened to &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;, namely &lt;strong&gt;Bon Iver&lt;/strong&gt;’s self-titled album. It has received so many good reviews that I have been too intimidated to listen to it. I will try to write about it next month.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understated Classics #10: Tubular Bells II by Mike Oldfield</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/understated-classics-10/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was the artwork that got me interested in Tubular Bells II. Rendering Trevor Key&amp;rsquo;s wonderful icon of the twisted tubular bell in yellow and blue made it all the more mysterious. Seeing it one day in Woolworth&amp;rsquo;s in Leigh Park back in 1992 aroused my curiosity. The huge display must have been part of the massive publicity drive for the album. Despite dwindling sales for his albums at that time, a sequel to Tubular Bells represented a huge potential for sales. This is why Oldfield had been lured from his previous home at Virgin records over to Warner Music. At that point Oldfield had not made a good album since his soundtrack to the movie &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087553/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Killing Fields&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 1985, the end of a hot streak (perhaps 1980&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;QE2&lt;/em&gt; aside) that had lasted since the original &lt;em&gt;Tubular Bells&lt;/em&gt; back in 1973.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What’s your favourite number?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was ambivalent on this issue until a few months ago until I came across the following quirky result: if you start with the prime number 41 and then add 2 you get 43, which is also prime and then if you add 4 to 43, you get 47: also prime. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=evaluate+x%5E2%E2%88%92x%2B41+for+x+from+0..40&#34;&gt;And this continues to produce prime numbers if you add successive multiples of two to your running total&lt;/a&gt;, UNTIL… you get to the 41st number in this sequence, which is 41 squared.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

CCTV, the GPS on your phone or the signals sent by your more primitive model to the masts to keep in touch with the network. Your cash withdrawals, your purchases in Tesco and your journeys on public transport all add to the picture of where you are. If you drive, your sat nav will hold clues to where you have been and, if you disappear, where you might have gone to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Four albums this month:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Kate Bush &lt;em&gt;Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Africa Hitech &lt;em&gt;93 Million Miles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fleet Foxes &lt;em&gt;Helplessness Blues&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;TV On The Radio &lt;em&gt;Nine Types of Light&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a pleasing red hue to all the covers this month. I had time to write four full reviews of the major albums I listened to. Like last month I have included a video at the foot of each review. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;kate-bush-directors-cut&#34;&gt;Kate Bush &lt;em&gt;Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt; is not a new album from Kate Bush but a collection of re-visits to old songs, four from &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sensual_World&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sensual World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (1989) and seven from [&lt;em&gt;The Red Shoes&lt;/em&gt;](&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Shoes_(album)&#34;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Shoes_(album)&lt;/a&gt; (1993). It is certainly an interesting idea to re-examine old songs with hindsight, something usually only done with live albums or dodgy remixes. It is rare to have an artist to even admit flaws in their earlier material, let alone for them to go back and attempt to fix them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understated Classics #9: Tiger Bay by Saint Etienne</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tiger Bay&lt;/em&gt; is Saint Etienne&amp;rsquo;s third album and I think it is among their best. It was released in June 1994 on Heavenly records. I first owned a copy in 1998 when I picked it up while living in halls as an undergraduate. The reason for including this album in the understated classics series is the same as for &lt;a href=&#34;uc8&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Second Light&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Dreadzone: it marries traditional forms to newer electronic music&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Second Light&lt;/em&gt; melds classical music and sea shanties to house and dub reggae to evoke the rolling hills and mystic caves of England. &lt;em&gt;Tiger Bay&lt;/em&gt; grafts folk structures on to Balearic pop songs and electronic experiments in order to visit motorway verges, windswept seashores, and Mediterranean holidays. There is even a ghost story (&lt;em&gt;Boy Scouts of America&lt;/em&gt;) for good measure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The other day while writing some rather self-pitying notes in my blog book (yes, I handwrite all this rubbish before I go to bed at night!) I came up with some useless superheroes, or rather the only superheroes that a washed-up guy in his early thirties could hope to be. Because I haven’t got any ideas for “five things on the fifth” this month, I decided to flesh out a few of these. Last month I began the five on the fifth meme with &lt;a href=&#34;five-things-to-try-when-you-cant-sleep&#34;&gt;five things to try if you can’t sleep&lt;/a&gt; and so this is a rather forced attempt to keep it going. I promise that I will try and think of more interesting posts on these lines for months.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;album-of-the-month-mirrorwriting-by-jamie-woon&#34;&gt;Album of the month: &lt;em&gt;Mirrorwriting&lt;/em&gt; by Jamie Woon&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jamie Woon was brought to my attention late last year by Pitchfork who wrote an article about the video for lead single &lt;em&gt;Night Air&lt;/em&gt;. I’ve put that video down below because I think that it is very good, a simple well executed and the tune itself is brilliant, probably my favourite individual track of 2010. It’s a downtempo tune full of dark spaces and empty beats, full of nocturnal promise and mystery. Hungry for more, I also bought the &lt;em&gt;Wayfaring Stranger&lt;/em&gt; EP and pre-ordered &lt;em&gt;Mirrorwriting&lt;/em&gt; as soon as it was possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why I Love Betty Blue</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I saw &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090563/&#34;&gt;Betty Blue&lt;/a&gt; (original French title &lt;em&gt;37,2 Le Matin&lt;/em&gt;) for the first time in 1996 shortly after having read the book and it remains one of my favourite films to this day. Although there are &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.co.uk/images?hl=en&amp;amp;source=hp&amp;amp;biw=1427&amp;amp;bih=1022&amp;amp;q=b%C3%A9atrice+dalle+betty+blue&amp;amp;gbv=2&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;aqi=&amp;amp;oq=&amp;amp;uss=1&#34;&gt;many obvious reasons why&lt;/a&gt; a sixteen year old boy might like it, I think it does stand up to scrutiny beyond the sex and nudity. This post is a brief explanation of some of the obvious and not-so-obvious reasons why this is a film to be loved and cherished. (It was quite interesting to write this defence of a sexy film!)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Facebook is wonderful for keeping in touch but I’ve noticed that quite a few of my friends tend to use it to tell the world that they can’t sleep. Here’s some advice for you if you find yourself unable to sleep one night. I’ve often had to try these out myself! Note that these are just things that work for me and your mileage may vary, particularly if you are fortunate enough to have a partner next to you! You may need to appease them if you wriggle around too much.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Favourite Culture Ship Names</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before &lt;a href=&#34;more-books&#34;&gt;I am re-reading the novels of Iain Banks&lt;/a&gt; and this weekend I managed to finish &lt;em&gt;Consider Phlebas&lt;/em&gt;. A little post about it will be coming up soon. One of my favourite things about the Culture novels is how the ships are named and having found &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ships_(The_Culture)&#34;&gt;a list on Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, I thought I would share ten of my favourites with you!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll Clean That Up Before You Leave&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ravished By The Sheer Implausibility Of That Last Statement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;All Through With This Niceness And Negotiation Stuff&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prosthetic Conscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Of Course I Still Love You&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Size Isn’t Everything&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hand Me The Gun And Ask Me Again&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dramatic Exit, Or, Thank you And Goodnight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;We Haven’t Met But You’re A Great Fan Of Mine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anticipation Of A New Lover’s Arrival, The&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Great names all I am sure you would agree. Not all of them appear as fully developed characters. In fact (and I will mention this again later) the ships don’t get nearly enough time as characters in the novels apart from &lt;em&gt;Excession&lt;/em&gt;, which is almost entirely devoted to them. In that novel, one ship is central to the story and is probably my favourite, an eccentric GCU (General Contact Unit) called &lt;em&gt;Grey Area&lt;/em&gt; that has been shunned by the other machines for “non-consensual mind reading”. It turns out the ship is somewhat morbid and likes to confront the perpetrators of genocides with their crimes. It is known by the other ships as “the meatf***er” and is totally badass.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As promised, I sidestepped the new R.E.M. and Elbow albums - although I had been promised the latter as a birthday present it is yet to show up, maybe I will look at in April.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;never-mind-the-ballards&#34;&gt;Never mind the Ballards&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been writing about books by &lt;a href=&#34;j-g-ballard&#34;&gt;J.G. Ballard&lt;/a&gt; pretty much to the exclusion of all others. Gradually the posts have tricked out about four novels and ground to a halt. I’ve got a fair way through two other books but I am getting very tired of reading his novels all the time, much as I love them. The mistake I made was that I hadn’t read enough of them in the first place. The project for the site was get the books, read them and then write something. In terms of writing regular posts, this was a bad idea!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understated Classics #8: Second Light by Dreadzone</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&#34;understated-classics&#34;&gt;understated classics&lt;/a&gt; series, I try to alternate between pop/rock and electronic albums. Keeping with this trend number eight is the wonderful dub-infused album &lt;em&gt;Second Light&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dreadzone.com&#34;&gt;Dreadzone&lt;/a&gt;. Released in 1996 it was well-received critically and four of its tracks featured on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/&#34;&gt;John Peel&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s best-of-year list that year. &lt;em&gt;Little Britain&lt;/em&gt; received a lot of radio play, a popular choice for that flag-waving period of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mojo4music.com/13834/the-story-of-britpop-in-60-albums/&#34;&gt;britpop&lt;/a&gt; and assorted other demons.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The strengths of &lt;em&gt;Second Light&lt;/em&gt; as an album is the anglicana&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of its first half and the subversion of it in the second half. I often talk of how albums are front-loaded with the best tracks to get you immersed in them. This is probably a hangover from vinyl where you could repeatedly play one side, making it necessary to make cohesive &amp;lsquo;sides&amp;rsquo; of music.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;February, the shortest month, harbinger of such delights as Groundhog Day and Valentine’s Day. Could it possibly produce any good albums? Well the candidates are the eponymous début album by &lt;strong&gt;James Blake&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Zonoscope&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Cut/Copy&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Let England Shake&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;PJ Harvey&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Smart Flesh&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;The Low Anthem&lt;/strong&gt;. Furthermore, there was an unexpected bonus when &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.radiohead.com/deadairspace/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radiohead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; announced that their new album would be out and available to listen to this month too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hurrah for more exoplanets &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2011/feb/02/new-planets-solar-system&#34;&gt;making the news&lt;/a&gt; this week. This time it is a star with a whole bunch of small planets very close to the star, usually they tend to be single gas giants larger even than &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter&#34;&gt;Jupiter&lt;/a&gt; as this &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_exoplanetary_host_stars&#34;&gt;list of stars with exoplanets&lt;/a&gt; from Wikipedia shows.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But these stars are all so far away! The closest star with an exoplanet found in orbit around it so far is 10 light years away (Epsilon Eridani) and this week’s system was found over 2000 light years away. To put this in perspective, Voyager 2 is &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/#!/Voyager2/status/32589239199731713&#34;&gt;currently 11 hours 13 minutes and 52 seconds of light travel from Earth&lt;/a&gt; just over 33 years after launch. It hasn’t really left our solar system yet - it is twice as far from the sun as Pluto but not as far as planet X - and according to current calculations it will next encounter a star (Sirius) in 290,000 years time, by which time it will be 8.6 light years from Earth and its instruments will be long dead.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It turns out that programming the UNO game is not that complicated once you start designing the thing. This post will get the rules and game elements clear.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-deck&#34;&gt;The deck&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An UNO deck consists of four sets of coloured cards (red, yellow, green and blue) together with eight wild cards. The non-wild cards are marked with either numbers or special symbols. The numbers range from zero to nine with two of each number except for the zero, which is unique. For each colour there are also two each of three kinds of special card: SKIP, SWAP and DRAW. The eight wild cards are divided into four each of two types: WILD and WILDFOUR. The wild cards are usually black in UNO decks so we may refer to them as black cards on occasion. There are one hundred and eight cards in total.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;form-and-function-deformation-and-dysfunction&#34;&gt;Form and function, deformation and dysfunction&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think we should get one thing out of the way first. For me, there is nothing erotic about a car or a motorway. The place in popular culture of the car in particular as sexual icon has always bemused me. In fact, I’m really rather ambivalent about cars. This matters when discussing &lt;em&gt;Crash&lt;/em&gt;, the 1973 novel by JG Ballard that resumes this strand of posts about his novels. (You can read about &lt;em&gt;The Drowned World&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/the-drowned-world/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Drought&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/the-drought/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Crystal World&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/the-crystal-world/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s to 2011 and the start of a monthly album digest. I want it to be a brief trot through some of the albums I have listened to each month. Sometimes January can bring a few quiet releases by big name bands. This happens if the previous album did not do as well as the record company hoped or if it is the kind of artist who would get lost under the hype of all the Christmas releases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve found twitter to be a bit boring lately but today a perfect storm brew up and once again the Daily Mail and one of its odious columnists was at its centre. Melanie Phillips’ opinion piece was a perfectly constructed piece of trolling that implied that since the repeal of section 28, schools have been flooded with an influx of gay propaganda in subjects like maths, history and geography. Well I’m all for it, Alan Turing &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a genius brutally mistreated by his country despite turning the second world war in favour of the allies - that story is maths and history is combined. Meanwhile, if you can spice up geography a bit go for it. I am not sure what you would do, discuss routes for pride marches? After all, the subject is hideously out of date now that we all have google maps on our phones.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Idewild are a solid band who have released four or five albums that I could consider for this series. I&amp;rsquo;m even in the sleeve credits of one: &lt;em&gt;Post-Electric Blues&lt;/em&gt;, if you&amp;rsquo;re asking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the end I went for &lt;em&gt;100 Broken Windows&lt;/em&gt; because it means a lot to me. It has more of a place in my life than the others. Usually I find that this happens if I can remember where I bought an album. In this case I bought a copy of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22533522&#34;&gt;cassette&lt;/a&gt; in Bath HMV at Easter 2000. I can remember the first time that I listened to it too, it was as I marched home to Oldfield Park down Bathwick hill from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bath.ac.uk&#34;&gt;university&lt;/a&gt; that same afternoon. It took exactly the two sides of the tape to get from one door to the other.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This is a shame because it is a very interesting subject and I find that the problem solving aspects of programming are very satisfying. Keenly aware of the need to do more hobby programming and to get up to speed on areas of software development that I’ve been neglecting, I have decided to give myself the project of creating a computerised version of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_(card_game)&#34;&gt;UNO card game&lt;/a&gt;. I know that one already exists, for example there’s an official one that you can play on MSN messenger.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The Shamen are either one of the pantheon of great acts from early 90&amp;rsquo;s dance and electronic music, or they are a shameless vaudeville novelty act.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the run there has been a bit of a hiatus in this blog. I wrote about how running was making me feel better. In fact, I should have said more. I recently stopped taking the antidepressants that I had been taking for eighteen months. This has been my longest period taking such medication but the running made me feel sufficiently good to decide that I could stop taking them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I try to pick albums that are at least ten years old but every now and then, I will think of an album that matches the sort of things I want to write about. That&amp;rsquo;s the case here. &lt;em&gt;A Weekend in the City&lt;/em&gt; is an unusual album that, in a reversal of the old adage, is “easy to love but hard to admire”. Nevertheless I do love and admire it, and I would like to share my thoughts about it with you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At last, Ballard in full flow. The Crystal World (TCW) is definitely the most enjoyable of the early trio of apocalyptic novels. It takes the successful elements of the first two and embellishes them with new details and ideas. At time of writing, TCW is definitely the best Ballard novel that I have read in its entirety.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I bought this album in the summer between my two years at college. I remember listening to this music under skies glowering with clouds so 1997 must have been a poor summer. I’d just bought a book of photography too, which placed photos from the north and south poles on opposite pages. I bought it mainly for the penguins that were, of course, on pretty much every other page. The pictures of&#xA;snow and ice soon became the ideal companions to this album.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>J. G. Ballard, The Drought</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On to The Drought by J. G. Ballard in &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/posts/j-g-ballard/&#34;&gt;my ongoing quest to read and review all of his novels&lt;/a&gt;. This is his second novel, if we assume his convention of never acknowledging “The Wind From Nowhere” as being his first novel. “The Drought” itself was renamed from “The Burning World” and additional content added later on. This was quite common practice in SF in the 50s and 60s where novels were serialised in magazines like &lt;a href=&#34;http://philsp.com/mags/amazing_stories.html&#34;&gt;Amazing SF&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://ttapress.com/interzone/about/&#34;&gt;Interzone&lt;/a&gt;. It is evidence though of Ballard finding his voice as he wrote and from The Drought it is easy to see that he is iterating his thought processes and subject matter with each novel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“The Drought” is marvellous in a way that “The Drowned World” is not. Here Ballard has cut away much of the ropy science of that novel and left us with a much more realistic scenario of global drought without having to worry about all the outré trappings of giant iguanas and dragonflies the size of your head. Instead, all the magnetic and mesmerising elements of Ballard’s work are beginning to take form: the eccentric recluse with possible sinister intent, the confused and detached protagonist, the ambivalently regarded woman of standing, the encroachment of nature and the human tendency to defile pretty much all it touches, including all that it has constructed and lived alongside.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;does-science-fiction-have-to-be-believable-to-be-meaningful&#34;&gt;Does Science Fiction have to be believable to be meaningful?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Should science fiction have predictive power? In plotting the vast unknowns of the future, should authors aim for prescience? Will people be able to say of the best SF novels in five hundred years time that some novels were right about some things and that these novels are better than the ones that didn’t?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would say no, otherwise we would be remarkably unfair on an awful lot of good writing. That said, I doubt that SF is read for the futurology. As with all literature, SF is at it is best when it has something to say about the world around us now, no matter when it may be set. And if SF has any kind of predictive record, it does better when the psychological issues arising from continued technological development are considered over the mere technology of that advancement. In the long run, a fictional account of space dog Laika (does one exist?) that rings true emotionally will probably endure longer than a pulp novel entitled “Dogs In Space!” (though that is a great title!).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understated Classics #2: Sinking by The Aloof</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-discovered-the-aloof-while-listening-to-the-top-40&#34;&gt;I discovered The Aloof while listening to the Top 40&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I was younger, I used to listen to the Top 40 every Sunday. To begin with, this was partly an endurance thing and partly an obsession with one day seeing Roxette top the charts - alas, they never did, though for one thrilling spring “Joyride” did flirt with the upper reaches of the chart.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Listening to the charts is probably the best way to become a lover of music. Nearly all my musical loves stem from listening to the top 40 chart, either directly from crouching next to my static-y radio on Sunday evening, or as something that evolving beyond those initial tastes later on. I soon realised that listening to music at the lower end of the chart was more rewarding and not just because this was where all &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Your_Heart&#34;&gt;the later Roxette singles ended up&lt;/a&gt;. It was where all the oddities washed in, sometimes there one week and never to be heard again - sometimes growing up into something big. I remember first hearing &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.prideofmanchester.com/music/ucc.htm&#34;&gt;“The Key The Secret” by the Urban Cookie Collective&lt;/a&gt; entering the chart at number 40, it eventually climbed to number 2. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/content/articles/2004/11/20/entertainment_music_local_bands_kws_feature.shtml&#34;&gt;Also “Please Don’t Go” by KWS which crept all the way up to number 1&lt;/a&gt; - these were great dance records that grew by word of mouth at a time when great dance records were weird and new and meant something.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week Arcade Fire released their hotly anticipated third album &amp;ldquo;The Suburbs&amp;rdquo;.  I loved &amp;ldquo;Neon Bible&amp;rdquo; but critics found it preachy, as overbearing as the religious folk it sought to satirise. I disagree and think it was an impressive continuation from an exciting debut. &amp;ldquo;The Suburbs&amp;rdquo; steps on from their previous two albums, both in subject matter and tone. It&amp;rsquo;s sad, thoughtful, resigned, angry and tetchy - among other things. “The Suburbs” isn&amp;rsquo;t the understated classic that I want to discuss though: with all the praise and plaudits, it may never suit this new thread of posts. I want to write about &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Together_Alone&#34;&gt;Together Alone by Crowded House&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading &amp;ldquo;Crash&amp;rdquo; at 17 left me in a state of numb shock. It got me hooked and left me with &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._G._Ballard&#34;&gt;J. G. Ballard&lt;/a&gt; as one of my favourite authors. I then devoured a short story collection called &amp;ldquo;Myths of the Near Future&amp;rdquo; around the same time. You may recognise it because the Klaxons appropriated the title for their debut album. Those stories captured my imagination, in particular the eponymous story of a world gone to run amid &amp;ldquo;space sickness&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
