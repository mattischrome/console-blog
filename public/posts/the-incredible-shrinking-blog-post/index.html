<h1>The Incredible Shrinking Blog Post</h1>
<p>Feb. 7, 2025</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>The problem with keeping up a blog streak for however many days it is now is that you don&rsquo;t actually get a huge amount of time to think of ideas for posts and actually write them. Ironically, I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this post for a while though.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve become very aware that I&rsquo;m dredging up posts from old drafts or old notes and not really adding much to them. Sometimes, when I&rsquo;ve decided what to write in advance, a lot of ideas circle within my head right up until it&rsquo;s time to write&hellip; and then nothing.</p>
<p>Still, the streak is now driving me onwards. It&rsquo;s motivating me to think about what else I could be doing to make the writing of daily posts a little bit easier. I do have a stack of prompts in my drawer, albeit for a rather staid and academic set of posts. I need to sit down with that and figure out the gamut of posts that I can write. It&rsquo;s a list I have had for quite some time now, so I probably need to refresh it.</p>
<p>The trouble is, I&rsquo;ve always been a &ldquo;some day&rdquo; kind of guy. At least until I wasn&rsquo;t. I am as surprised as anyone that I went around South America, that I got married, that I managed to buy a house (I think the key to the latter two is that I am part of a super-ace team). But at least now I have a streak to support!</p>
<p>I think the key to it will be to have a few brainstorming sessions before writing a post. Another idea would be to write out the basic structure of a post in the morning and then come back to it later in the day. The last couple of days it has got to 10pm and I&rsquo;ve gone &ldquo;oh heck what&rsquo;s today&rsquo;s post&rdquo;, which is not very sustainable.</p>
<p>I am pleased to have got started. That&rsquo;s always the hardest part, and it&rsquo;s true whether you&rsquo;re writing every day or every month. Whatever the deadline happens to be, it always rolls around soon enough. And then the next hardest part is to keep going. So let&rsquo;s see if I can figure that out too.</p>
