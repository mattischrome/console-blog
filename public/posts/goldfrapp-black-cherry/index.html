<h1>Goldfrapp - Black Cherry</h1>
<p>Jun. 2, 2023</p>
<br/><br/>
<p><em>This is the first in an unplanned series of <strong>album revisits</strong>, I will write a post explaining the process soon.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Cherry_(Goldfrapp_album)">&ldquo;Black Cherry&rdquo;</a> is the second album by Goldfrapp, released in 2003. I bought the lead single Train while I lived in York and also the single of the title track because by then I&rsquo;d discovered M83 and they&rsquo;d done a remix of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black Cherry&rdquo; finds the band faced with following their successful and chilled out debut album &ldquo;Felt Mountain&rdquo;, which back in 2000 had sounded notably weird. But nobody wants to sound like a kook forever, sometimes people want to let their hair down and just dance. That&rsquo;s very much what the first two tracks anyway, especially the pulsating &ldquo;Train&rdquo;. To my ears, I was definitely pleased when I first played the single - I love that relentless synth riff that sounds like it&rsquo;s being fed through about seventy FX pedals. I vaguely remember the single&rsquo;s B-side &ldquo;Big Black Cloud, Little White Lie&rdquo; and the Village Hall Remix being pretty ace too. Fortunately they&rsquo;re also on streaming, so I was able to check. I think I liked the B-side because it sounded very much like a &ldquo;Felt Mountain&rdquo; outtake - twenty years ago I likely appreciated the familiarity but today it serves a reminder that while &ldquo;Felt Mountain 2&rdquo; would have been nice, &ldquo;Black Cherry&rdquo; definitely benefitted from changing things up a bit. The Remix is mostly instrumental and adds even more Glitter beat stomp to Train, pleasant enough I guess.</p>

<p>The title track is also quite like the songs on &ldquo;Felt Mountain&rdquo;, a seductive croon that sounds like something you&rsquo;d hear on an advert for luxury yoghurt (not a bad thing!) or a dark chocolate bar. It&rsquo;s a bit more solid and less string-dependent than &ldquo;Big Black Cloud, Little White Lie&rdquo;. The M83 remix is gorgeous and probably my preferred version.
ith
&ldquo;Tiptoe&rdquo; is pretty squelchy and listening to it today for probably the first time in about a decade, I guess you could say it would have sat quite nicely on any of their later albums, well the dancey ones anyway. It has a nice loop that sounds like a sample from a computer game, something that later bands like Little Dragon tuned into. It also builds into something that sounds like a more animated version of a song like &ldquo;Utopia&rdquo;, drifting on swelling strings and a heartfelt chorus. I think the fade is a bit naff though.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deep Honey&rdquo; sounds a bit more like the writing she did for Tricky on &ldquo;Pumpkin&rdquo;, though with more discernible lyrics. I think that even &ldquo;Felt Mountain&rdquo; had followed the tendency of Alison&rsquo;s other collaborators (e.g. Orbital, Tricky, etc) of obscuring her words. By this point of &ldquo;Black Cherry&rdquo; a standout feature of the songs is how much clearer they were, how you can hear what she&rsquo;s singing as well as getting hooked on how she&rsquo;s singing it. It&rsquo;s another song that fades disappointingly.</p>
<p>With hindsight, &ldquo;Hairy Trees&rdquo; seems to be the prototype for the sorts of songs that would dominate albums like &ldquo;The Seventh Tree&rdquo; and &ldquo;Life of us&rdquo;, a sort of pastoral electronica that&rsquo;s trying to rewrite those weird folk songs that punctuate the director&rsquo;s cut of &ldquo;The Wicker Man&rdquo;. It bubbles down into a serene mix of bubbling beats, la la las, and sweet strings, before disappearing into another disappointing fade.</p>
<p>Two more singles &ldquo;Twist&rdquo; and &ldquo;Strict Machine&rdquo; are next, both are pretty uptempo for Goldfrapp and show the way to their fantastic third album &ldquo;Supernature&rdquo;. I think I always dismissed these songs as novelties at the time, there was definitely a feeling that &ldquo;Black Cherry&rdquo; had repeated &ldquo;Felt Mountain&rdquo; but with these extra songs that didn&rsquo;t really fit and made everything messy. Thankfully, the band must have had a sense of what was working well, as &ldquo;Strict Machine&rdquo; still sounds utterly awesome twenty years later and &ldquo;Supernature&rdquo; (at least as I remember it) is one of those all-killer-no-filler albums that I&rsquo;m now superkeen to listen to again.</p>
<p>On &ldquo;Black Cherry&rdquo; though, the album drifts off on &ldquo;Forever&rdquo; and &ldquo;Slippage&rdquo;. The former is another example of how they&rsquo;d gained enough confidence to have Alison sing the words clearly, words that aren&rsquo;t about her dog needing new ears. It&rsquo;s a nice song but a bit of a letdown after &ldquo;Strict Machine&rdquo; (another prolonged fade out too). I think &ldquo;Slippage&rdquo; deliberately echoes &ldquo;Oompa Radar&rdquo; from the first album, but unfortunately it sounds like a bad Future Sound of London B-side. It&rsquo;s only worth repeating a trick if you can give a new spin on it.</p>
<p>Taken as a whole twenty years later, you can sort of see why people were surprised when Goldfrapp went &ldquo;pop&rdquo; two years later. It wasn&rsquo;t so much the mainstream catching up to them, so much as the band catching up to themselves. The recipes for many of Goldfrapp&rsquo;s later successes are here on &ldquo;Black Cherry&rdquo; but this time around they were a bit undercooked.</p>
