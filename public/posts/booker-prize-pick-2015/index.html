I was delighted when Kiran Desai&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Inheritance of Loss&rdquo; won the previous year. That&rsquo;s part of my affection for &ldquo;Satin Island&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s a book that will make people go &ldquo;huh?&rdquo; if they&rsquo;re driven to reading it via a prize win."/>

<h1>My Booker Prize Pick 2015</h1>
<p>Oct. 12, 2015</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>&ldquo;<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/10/man-booker-shortlist-2015-satin-island/408784/">Satin Island</a>&rdquo; is my pick for the <a href="http://themanbookerprize.com/man-booker-prize-2015">Man Booker prize</a>, announced tomorrow. I&rsquo;ve not managed to read all of it yet. Also, I&rsquo;ve only glanced at the others on <a href="http://themanbookerprize.com/news/man-booker-prize-fiction-2015-shortlist-revealed">the shortlist</a>.</p>
<p>My prediction record on selecting the winner of the Booker from the shortlist is pretty good, though all I&rsquo;m ever doing is guess the outcome of a 1 in 6 chance, like the roll of a die. Often it&rsquo;s a book that I really hope will win rather than one I know will (except &ldquo;Wolf Hall&rdquo; and its sequel). I still think the world is a worse place for <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/fictionreviews/3665324/Man-Booker-2007-Prize-Darkmans.html">Nicola Barker&rsquo;s &ldquo;Darkmans&rdquo;</a> not winning the prize back in 2007. I was delighted when <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/oct/11/books.bookerprize2006">Kiran Desai&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Inheritance of Loss&rdquo; won the previous year</a>. That&rsquo;s part of my affection for &ldquo;Satin Island&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s a book that will make people go &ldquo;huh?&rdquo; if they&rsquo;re driven to reading it via a prize win.</p>
<p>Obviously McCarthy has come to my attention before. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(novel)">&ldquo;C&rdquo; was nominated in 2010</a>, the year that Howard Jacobson&rsquo;s <a href="http://themanbookerprize.com/books/finkler-question">&ldquo;The Finkler Question&rdquo;</a> won. I was determined to read &ldquo;C&rdquo; anyway but somehow never did: I&rsquo;d been intrigued by its titular similarity to Pynchon&rsquo;s &ldquo;V&rdquo; and the scribbly cover of its first edition (not the awful American cover <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(novel)">on the wikipedia page</a> for the novel). Generally when an author gets Booker nominated for two consecutive novels, it&rsquo;s a sign that they are doing something right, hence my interest in &ldquo;Satin Island&rdquo;. This is with the usual caveats that prizes don&rsquo;t detect good writing, you do, but they do tend to help.</p>
<p>From what I&rsquo;ve read so far, Satin Island is an interesting take on what the novel might become rather than a shining example of technique. What I mean is that - at least for now - Satin Island strikes me as a worthy winner for its imagination and innovation in taking the novel as a form forwards. In the chapters I&rsquo;ve read so far, it&rsquo;s full of ideas and thoughts and hops between them consummately. However, I&rsquo;ll only know if it&rsquo;s worth persisting with if I manage to persist with it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quite short (the shortest of the remaining nominations by a fair way) so I should get through it in the next week or so. Expect a short review around then - especially if it wins tomorrow!</p>
