        <p><p>Hurrah for more exoplanets <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2011/feb/02/new-planets-solar-system">making the news</a> this week. This time it is a star with a whole bunch of small planets very close to the star, usually they tend to be single gas giants larger even than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter">Jupiter</a> as this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_exoplanetary_host_stars">list of stars with exoplanets</a> from Wikipedia shows.</p>
<p>But these stars are all so far away! The closest star with an exoplanet found in orbit around it so far is 10 light years away (Epsilon Eridani) and this week’s system was found over 2000 light years away. To put this in perspective, Voyager 2 is <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Voyager2/status/32589239199731713">currently 11 hours 13 minutes and 52 seconds of light travel from Earth</a> just over 33 years after launch. It hasn’t really left our solar system yet - it is twice as far from the sun as Pluto but not as far as planet X - and according to current calculations it will next encounter a star (Sirius) in 290,000 years time, by which time it will be 8.6 light years from Earth and its instruments will be long dead.</p></p>

        <p>Feb. 2, 2011</p>
        <p><p>It turns out that programming the UNO game is not that complicated once you start designing the thing. This post will get the rules and game elements clear.</p>
<h4 id="the-deck">The deck</h4>
<p>An UNO deck consists of four sets of coloured cards (red, yellow, green and blue) together with eight wild cards. The non-wild cards are marked with either numbers or special symbols. The numbers range from zero to nine with two of each number except for the zero, which is unique. For each colour there are also two each of three kinds of special card: SKIP, SWAP and DRAW. The eight wild cards are divided into four each of two types: WILD and WILDFOUR. The wild cards are usually black in UNO decks so we may refer to them as black cards on occasion. There are one hundred and eight cards in total.</p></p>

<p>I think we should get one thing out of the way first. For me, there is nothing erotic about a car or a motorway. The place in popular culture of the car in particular as sexual icon has always bemused me. In fact, I’m really rather ambivalent about cars. This matters when discussing <em>Crash</em>, the 1973 novel by JG Ballard that resumes this strand of posts about his novels. (You can read about <em>The Drowned World</em> <a href="/the-drowned-world/">here</a>, <em>The Drought</em> <a href="/the-drought/">here</a> and <em>The Crystal World</em> <a href="/the-crystal-world/">here</a>).</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 31, 2011</p>
        <p><p>Here’s to 2011 and the start of a monthly album digest. I want it to be a brief trot through some of the albums I have listened to each month. Sometimes January can bring a few quiet releases by big name bands. This happens if the previous album did not do as well as the record company hoped or if it is the kind of artist who would get lost under the hype of all the Christmas releases.</p></p>

        <p><p>I’ve found twitter to be a bit boring lately but today a perfect storm brew up and once again the Daily Mail and one of its odious columnists was at its centre. Melanie Phillips’ opinion piece was a perfectly constructed piece of trolling that implied that since the repeal of section 28, schools have been flooded with an influx of gay propaganda in subjects like maths, history and geography. Well I’m all for it, Alan Turing <em>was</em> a genius brutally mistreated by his country despite turning the second world war in favour of the allies - that story is maths and history is combined. Meanwhile, if you can spice up geography a bit go for it. I am not sure what you would do, discuss routes for pride marches? After all, the subject is hideously out of date now that we all have google maps on our phones.</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 9, 2011</p>
        <p><p>Idewild are a solid band who have released four or five albums that I could consider for this series. I&rsquo;m even in the sleeve credits of one: <em>Post-Electric Blues</em>, if you&rsquo;re asking.</p>
<p>In the end I went for <em>100 Broken Windows</em> because it means a lot to me. It has more of a place in my life than the others. Usually I find that this happens if I can remember where I bought an album. In this case I bought a copy of the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22533522">cassette</a> in Bath HMV at Easter 2000. I can remember the first time that I listened to it too, it was as I marched home to Oldfield Park down Bathwick hill from the <a href="www.bath.ac.uk">university</a> that same afternoon. It took exactly the two sides of the tape to get from one door to the other.</p></p>

<p>I don’t write about programming enough. This is a shame because it is a very interesting subject and I find that the problem solving aspects of programming are very satisfying. Keenly aware of the need to do more hobby programming and to get up to speed on areas of software development that I’ve been neglecting, I have decided to give myself the project of creating a computerised version of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_(card_game)">UNO card game</a>. I know that one already exists, for example there’s an official one that you can play on MSN messenger.</p></p>

<p>Three letters for Dad in the mail today, three variations on our surname including the aquatic <em>Dory</em> version and the lesser-spotted <em>Dorny</em>. It is perhaps best not to go back to the time he was accidentally listed in the Thompson directory as Mr. Dopey, bringing forth prank calls from all teenagers within a ten mile radius. Fortunately, Dr. Dorey doesn’t have this problem with his mail: he doesn’t get any.</p></p>

<p>Ask anyone into pop music between 1991 and 1993 about The Shamen, and you&rsquo;ll either receive a flood of euphoric good will about excellent tracks like <em>Move Any Mountain</em>, <em>LSI</em>, and <em>Phorever People</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>; or they will rant at you about the evils of <em>Ebeneezer Goode</em>. The Shamen are either one of the pantheon of great acts from early 90&rsquo;s dance and electronic music, or they are a shameless vaudeville novelty act.</p></p>

        <p><p>Since the run there has been a bit of a hiatus in this blog. I wrote about how running was making me feel better. In fact, I should have said more. I recently stopped taking the antidepressants that I had been taking for eighteen months. This has been my longest period taking such medication but the running made me feel sufficiently good to decide that I could stop taking them.</p></p>

<p>Happily the answer to both questions was a resounding “Yes!” and I really enjoyed it. The weather was really good, especially compared to the two days before hand, and Marc came along to take some brilliant photos.</p></p>

<p>This is the youngest album I have chosen for this series. I try to pick albums that are at least ten years old but every now and then, I will think of an album that matches the sort of things I want to write about. That&rsquo;s the case here. <em>A Weekend in the City</em> is an unusual album that, in a reversal of the old adage, is “easy to love but hard to admire”. Nevertheless I do love and admire it, and I would like to share my thoughts about it with you.</p></p>
