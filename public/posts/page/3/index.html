    <div><p>Having made it to one post per day in January, we now move into February: that graveyard of good habits for the new year. What is it about flipping over the calendar to a new month that does away with our resolve to continue with our resolutions? My office calendar has a lovely picture of a German steam train in the snow, in case you were wondering.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to reward myself at some point by allowing myself to fiddle with the blog&rsquo;s theme a little more. Over the years, I&rsquo;ve probably fiddled more with how the blog looks, rather than focussing on what to write. I&rsquo;ve also turned on Hugo&rsquo;s related posts module. The results are pretty high quality and it doesn&rsquo;t seem to affect the build time of the site. A custom version is still a pet project for the future though.</p></div>

<p>I used <a href="https://imagemagick.org">Imagemagick</a> to process the same files from <a href="/posts/in-praise-of-paris/">the Paris post</a> earlier this week. I made them a bit smaller, reduced the number of colours to 256, posterized them (a built-in Imagemagick function that groups colours), and then did a dither on them.</p></div>

    <div><p>When making my albums of the year posts at the start of the month, I realised that compared to many other critics lists, there was no sign of <em>Brat</em> by Charlie XCX. And when it came up again on my album shuffle the other day, I  thought I should re-evaluate the album and whether it should have made my list.</p>
<p>Listening to <em>Brat</em> again for this post, it was clear that I&rsquo;d missed out on something special. This was partly because I went for a walk with it on my headphones and that always lets me hear the details of the music. I think too many times when this album came on at home, it would be a little bit too doof-doof to be background music. These are songs that do demand (and deserve) a bit of attention.</p></div>

<p>I was a bit confused at the start of the show, as I had got my Carrington&rsquo;s wrong! I&rsquo;d been thinking this was a show about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonora_Carrington">Leonora Carrington</a> who was active later, initially in circles with Max Ernst, and later on in her own right in Mexico City. I will have to wait for a retrospective of her work another time.</p></div>

<p><em>Drift</em> had been an interesting experiment where Underworld had tried to put out a new track each week and grouping several weeks worth into EPs before putting out a massive 6+ hour box set. The striking thing about the project was that it was so good. They released a sampler edition of the album which cherry picked the best songs, but almost every track released as part of <em>Drift</em> could be swapped into that sampler.</p></div>

    <div><p>One of the absurd barriers to writing regularly is that my new post script is written to open the new markdown file in Neovim and until this week I had no idea how to type a hashtag (which markdown uses for headers) in this editor.</p>
<p>Neovim, and its venerable predecessors vi and vim, is notorious for being a bit tricksy to work with. This is because it is a modal editor: you use keys to switch the editor between modes. The same key presses mean different things in different modes, which can be frustrating when you first start out and have no clue what is going on.</p></div>

    <div><p>We had great success with our sticky toffee pudding as a Christmas Day dessert. It&rsquo;s a hybrid of a recipe by Jamie Oliver, one that we found in a gluten free cookbook, and one for <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/sticky_toffee_pudding_25161">a make-ahead pudding by the hairy bikers</a>.</p></div>
