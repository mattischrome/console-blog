        <p>Jun. 19, 2023</p>
        <p><p>It strikes me that it is better to sit and think about what you need to do, rather than endless try out new tools and hoping you end up with a use for them. I&rsquo;m not saying that innovation is bad, or that you shouldn&rsquo;t stretch yourself into some new spot once in a while, but you will become more valuable to others if you can identify what it is you are supposed to be doing and then use your existing skills to get that job done. Don&rsquo;t go looking at galleries of tools and techniques in service of finding something to do. Trust me, I know from experience that it is a great way to spend a hell of a lot of time not getting anywhere in particular.</p></p>

        <p>Jun. 8, 2023</p>
        <p><p>So today <a href="/how-random-should-things-be/">my random album script</a> picked out &ldquo;Bright Lights&rdquo; by Ellie Goulding, an album I wasn&rsquo;t sure I&rsquo;ve ever listened to. I looked in my music library and there it was! As a result this is not so much an <a href="/tag/album%20revisit/">album revisit</a> as an album _<em>visit</em>.</p>
<p>Anyway, this album was released in 2010 and did quite well. In fact, &ldquo;Bright Lights&rdquo; is a reissue of an album that was originally released as &ldquo;Lights&rdquo; (February 2010). This version adds seven extra tracks, which explains why it&rsquo;s an exhausting seventeen tracks long. &ldquo;Lights&rdquo; was a successful debut and a few of the singles went top 20, which is what led to its re-release with all those extra songs in November of the same year. (I think this is why it is in my collection, I think I bought it for my mum or for a sibling as part of a Christmas present, and ripped the CD out of curiosity&hellip;)</p></p>

        <h1><a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/hot-chocolate-comparison/" title="Hot Chocolate Comparison">Hot Chocolate Comparison</a></h1>
        <p>Jun. 7, 2023</p>
        <p><p>I&rsquo;m a massive fan of hot chocolate. Recently a friend recommended M&amp;S hot chocolate flakes. Thanks to a promotion it was about half the price of the Montezuma&rsquo;s hot chocolate discs that we usually buy. The Montezuma&rsquo;s ones are lush (that&rsquo;s official hot chocolate tasting terminology) but in this economy anything that saves a bit of money has got to be good right?</p>
<p>However, there are other things to consider. For one, what&rsquo;s the cost per drink? After reading the instructions for the M&amp;S hot chocolate, it was clear that it might not make as many drinks as the Montezuma&rsquo;s hot chocolate does.  That said, we prefer to use one disc rather than the suggested two,  and sure enough, we also found that we only needed about half the hot chocolate when using the M&amp;S flakes too. Nevertheless you still get 66% more drinks from the Montezuma&rsquo;s hot chocolate.</p></p>

        <p>Jun. 5, 2023</p>
        <p><p>This is one of my more played Fabric mix CDs so I decided to go for it when my random prompter plumped for this earlier today. One constraint of these posts was to write it in roughly the amount of time it takes to listen to it. You&rsquo;d think that for a mix CD that would be ok. After all, this mix is a full CD and 74 minutes long.</p></p>

        <p>Jun. 3, 2023</p>
        <p><p>I&rsquo;ve managed to extract my music library, including all the albums I&rsquo;ve added to streaming, as a CSV file and write a routine in R to select an album at random. The plan is to write about that album for the blog in roughly the time that it takes to listen to that album all the way through. I already did this yesterday for <a href="/goldfrapp-black-cherry">Goldfrapp&rsquo;s Black Cherry.</a></p>
<p>But I have to level with you. That was not the first album that was picked. Nor is the album selection process entirely unbiased. I got to a working situation and stopped there. Essentially, I smoosh together artist and album title, so that albums like compilations, or albums where the lead artist collaborates with multiple other artists, are slightly over-represented. I say slightly as the pool was already pretty large with just unique albums. I might do what I did yesterday and ignore singles or compilations, especially as the code takes almost zero time to give me another idea.</p></p>

        <h1><a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/goldfrapp-black-cherry/" title="Goldfrapp - Black Cherry">Goldfrapp - Black Cherry</a></h1>
        <p>Jun. 2, 2023</p>
        <p><p><em>This is the first in an unplanned series of <strong>album revisits</strong>, I will write a post explaining the process soon.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Cherry_(Goldfrapp_album)">&ldquo;Black Cherry&rdquo;</a> is the second album by Goldfrapp, released in 2003. I bought the lead single Train while I lived in York and also the single of the title track because by then I&rsquo;d discovered M83 and they&rsquo;d done a remix of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black Cherry&rdquo; finds the band faced with following their successful and chilled out debut album &ldquo;Felt Mountain&rdquo;, which back in 2000 had sounded notably weird. But nobody wants to sound like a kook forever, sometimes people want to let their hair down and just dance. That&rsquo;s very much what the first two tracks anyway, especially the pulsating &ldquo;Train&rdquo;. To my ears, I was definitely pleased when I first played the single - I love that relentless synth riff that sounds like it&rsquo;s being fed through about seventy FX pedals. I vaguely remember the single&rsquo;s B-side &ldquo;Big Black Cloud, Little White Lie&rdquo; and the Village Hall Remix being pretty ace too. Fortunately they&rsquo;re also on streaming, so I was able to check. I think I liked the B-side because it sounded very much like a &ldquo;Felt Mountain&rdquo; outtake - twenty years ago I likely appreciated the familiarity but today it serves a reminder that while &ldquo;Felt Mountain 2&rdquo; would have been nice, &ldquo;Black Cherry&rdquo; definitely benefitted from changing things up a bit. The Remix is mostly instrumental and adds even more Glitter beat stomp to Train, pleasant enough I guess.</p></p>

        <p>Jun. 1, 2023</p>
        <p><p>White rabbits and all that.</p>
<p>Even more than during the pandemic, I&rsquo;m feeling these days like the days, weeks, and months are all blurring into one another. It&rsquo;s getting harder to figure out what year something happened, how the old the cats are, and just how overdue all my promises are. It&rsquo;s definitely getting harder to look at this blog and wonder whether it will ever get back to its heyday of regularly posted updates. It&rsquo;s possible that the continued erosion of various social media sites might make blogs useful, useable, and used again, though popularity of a medium is no guarantee that I will actually use it!</p></p>

        <p>May. 31, 2023</p>
        <p><p>I gave up writing reviews of movies because:</p>
<ol>
<li>I never felt I got the balance right between describing the plot and why I liked the film.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t watch enough movies to be able to draw comparisons that are interesting, just between the small subset of total films that I have watched.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t know enough about film making to properly describe why a movie made me feel a particular way and how to discuss the different possibilities available to the director, the actors, and the other artists involved with creating a movie.</li>
</ol>
<p>But of course, every now and then you see a movie and think &ldquo;wow! I need to tell people about this&rdquo;. And for me that recent film was &ldquo;Decision To Leave&rdquo;, a Korean film that was released last year.</p></p>

        <p>Apr. 9, 2023</p>
        <p><p>A set of rules for living from now on (in no particular order)</p>
<ul>
<li>Life is too short to look at adverts. Avoid them where possible. Block them if you have to.</li>
<li>Embrace risk and chance, as they have contributed the most to where you are now.</li>
<li>Intervene into physical things and leave your mark upon them. Draw pictures on the blank pages of books, even if they are dear to you. Fill your notebooks <em>before</em> buying yourself new ones. Insert name tags in your clothes.</li>
<li>Every day should be an attempt to see new things, and out of things, people like most to be seen.</li>
<li>As good as it is to solve puzzles, try and avoid the rut of constantly solving the same puzzle lest it no longer require any mastery.</li>
<li>Learn the 13 times table. (This is where I need to start, then I will move up to 17 and on up through the prime numbers.)</li>
<li>Have a business card. Try to cram in as much information on both sides.</li>
<li>Write write write. I will not be happy until I put some sort of rubbish on my blog <strong>every day</strong>. Actually I could be writing three blogs but I need to get better at writing one first.</li>
<li>Write out lists of quotes that inspire you in a notebook. Give those notebooks out as gifts. It’s not like anyone will read the quotes, much less take them to heart. But at least they’ll have a sampler for decoding your written notes after you shuffle off the mortal coil.</li>
<li>If you have reached the age of forty three and don’t know how to knit, fucking well learn to knit a scarf. Of course, this does not apply to learning to drive, which is a violent and dangerous activity.</li>
<li>Ask people about their tattoos and indulge your curiosity about how much they/it might have hurt.</li>
<li>The reason for drawing terrible sketches, writing awful jokes and getting absolutely nowhere with the garden is simply to enjoy that process of being shit at things and making mistakes. Show people the bad stuff as well as the good stuff.</li>
<li>Even at the middle of your life, there aren’t that many lunches left. You might want to alternate between what you like and what you’re curious about. (I freely admit that at the moment I am a terrible stick in the mud when it comes to my very conventional lunches.)</li>
<li>Try to establish the clothes you most feel like yourself in (presumably these are also comfortable) and always wear those.</li>
<li>Touch typing is a skill that is surprisingly enjoyable to practice. It’s like getting your left and right brains together to plan a heist (while they argue over who gets the G and the Y)</li>
<li>Eat slowly, savour the flavours. Unless you are a guest and your host has expressed anxiety about the success of their culinary adventure, in that case you should savour or galumph it down as politeness dictates.</li>
<li>When you’re asking someone if they need a bit of help, remember that some people need more cajoling than others. Remember also that some people won’t feel comfortable accepting help no matter how you press; sometimes you have to come back to it later.</li>
<li>Adopt a new pose for every photo people take of you. Give the facial recognition overlords something to work with.</li>
</ul></p>

        <p><p>As with most years, I had hoped to start off 2023 with a flurry of new blog posts. Instead I caught Covid, which knocked me out for most of &lsquo;betweenmas&rsquo; and put paid to my hopes for a productive start to the year. At the time of writing this post, I only just feel like I have begun to get back to &rsquo;normal&rsquo;, or at least as normal as things have been since 2020.</p></p>

        <p>Oct. 29, 2022</p>
        <p><p>Went with my friend Nick to see The Orb at Concord 2 last night. The last time I&rsquo;d seen the Orb was back in 2004, at the start of their relatively dry spell. That night, they&rsquo;d been a bit lacklustre despite playing (some of) the hits and a relatively decent album in &ldquo;Bicycles and Tricycles&rdquo;. I left feeling that I&rsquo;d seen the past rather than the future, something that I wouldn&rsquo;t glimpse again in their records until 2015.</p></p>
