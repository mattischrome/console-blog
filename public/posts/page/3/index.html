        <p>Jan. 19, 2025</p>
        <p><p>I&rsquo;m having trouble finding something to write about today. Partly the problem of having a productive weekend of doing things rather than ruminating on blog topics. So unfortunately, we get another space-filling post.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got lots of books on the go at the moment, including &ldquo;Orbital&rdquo; which won the Booker prize this year and &ldquo;Otherlands&rdquo; which is a really cool book about natural history going back in time through the eras of the Earth.</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 18, 2025</p>
        <p><p>I&rsquo;ve written some guides about how to play as various leaders in Sid Meier&rsquo;s Civilization VI, covering <a href="https://mattischrome.com/posts/civ-leaders-1/">Hojo</a>, <a href="https://mattischrome.com/posts/civ-leaders-2/">Alexander</a>, <a href="https://mattischrome.com/posts/civ-leaders-3/">Amanitore</a>, and <a href="https://mattischrome.com/posts/civ-leaders-4/">Qin</a> in his Mandate of Heaven persona. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I also wrote a guide to Gorgo at some point but all I can find are game screenshots I took one of the times that I played as her.</p>
<p><img src="./images/gorgo_1.jpg" alt="A screenshot of a CIV VI game where I played as Gorgo"></p>
<p>As such, I lost momentum on what would have been quite a nice writing project. However, with less than a month to go until Civ VII, it doesn&rsquo;t seem as though writing those posts would even be useful for me.</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 17, 2025</p>
        <p><p>Having recently completed my review of 2024&rsquo;s best albums, I&rsquo;ve been reflecting on what a strange year it was for me in terms of the music I listened to. According to my Last.fm annual report, I listened to 51% <em>more</em> music in 2024 compared with 2023 (and 2023 was itself a peak listening year). Moreover, I listened to 709 artists, of which 37% were new discoveries. I listened to over 2 albums a day apparently, with <a href="https://mattischrome.com/posts/2024-albums-03-acopia/">Acopia</a> being the album I listened to most often. Apparently I was the 11th top listener on Last.fm of my number 1 album of the year <a href="https://mattischrome.com/posts/2024-albums-01-bolis-pupul-letter-to-yu/">Letter to Yu by Bolis Pupul</a>.</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 16, 2025</p>
        <p><p>One of the best pieces of advice I have ever been given about how to tackle programming problems is to treat your code as comments that describe your program to the computer, whilst the comments that are there for humans to read should tell them how the program is supposed to work.</p>
<p>In recent days I have come to a realisation that you also need to try and see things as the computer sees them, rather than expecting it to see what you can see. I was working with some data that were formatted in a pretty way for humans and I was completely flummoxed because I couldn&rsquo;t get <em>any</em> of it into R. The more I stared at the files, the more I began to see all these weird anomalies like completely blank columns that had been shrunk to near zero widths and inconsistencies between files with how the main components of the data were stored. It&rsquo;s been a strange experience!</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 15, 2025</p>
        <p><p><img src="./images/parquet-courts-sympathy-for-life.jpg" alt="Cover art of Sympathy for Life by Parquet Courts"></p>
<p>Getting back to my occasional album revisits, I&rsquo;d like to consider the 2021 Parquet Courts album &ldquo;Sympathy For Life&rdquo;. This is partly because I own it on vinyl and put it on the other day while I was doing some rather humdrum data downloading at work. It&rsquo;s that kind of album, quite loose and jam-based.</p>
<p>Recorded just before lockdown, first in New York then at the Real World studios in Box, the album seems eerily prescient of what was to come later in the Covid pandemic. These are songs about constantly being watched by AI and the sort of coddling of the modern mind that results from this. It&rsquo;s not quite as good as the previous album &ldquo;Wide Awake&rdquo; but is probably better than &ldquo;Human Performance&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s so relaxed and different to the previous album that you might have expected it to appear under their Parkay Quarts alias.</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 14, 2025</p>
        <p><h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 tbsp of sunflower oil or other high smoke point oil</li>
<li>60g cornflour</li>
<li>60g gluten-free flour</li>
<li>3 eggs</li>
<li>pinch of salt (if wanted)</li>
<li>pinch of sage (if wanted)</li>
<li>200ml of milk (substitute with non-dairy options if wanted)</li>
<li>Four sausages</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="method">Method</h2>
<ol>
<li>Preheat an oven to 220C (200C for a fan-assisted oven).</li>
<li>Pour some high smoke-point oil into a metal pan (approx one tablespoon), add the sausages and warm for five minutes in the oven while preparing the batter.</li>
<li>Mix flour, cornflour and eggs either by hand or with a stand mixer. Beat to a smooth paste.</li>
<li>Add salt if using. Once the mixture is smooth, start to slowly add the milk while continuing to beat the mixture.</li>
<li>Once all the milk has been added, continue to beat the mixture for a further minute or until lightly foaming.</li>
<li>Turn the sausages and return to the oven for two more minutes. In this time add dried herbs to the batter if using. Sage works well. Re-beat the mixture once last time.</li>
<li>Add the batter to the pan and cook for 25 minutes.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Flour ratios can be changed. E.g., you can use 70g/50g cornflour to flour. Don&rsquo;t use more than 125g total for the flours.</li>
<li>You may need slightly more oil if using vegetarian sausages.</li>
<li>In terms of alternative milks, a pea-based milk (e.g. Wunda milk) produces quite an aerated and crispy batter. We&rsquo;ve had less success with things like oat or soy milk.</li>
<li>This batter can also be used for Yorkshire pudding and for pancakes.</li>
<li>Try wrapping the sausages in bacon for a tasty (but rather unhealthy treat).</li>
<li>Most recipes prefer lard to oil, but oil is usually fine. Rape seed oil (AKA canola oil) is working well for us at the moment.</li>
</ul></p>

        <p>Jan. 13, 2025</p>
        <p><p>In searching for something to write about today, I wondered whether I had ever written about Pilates on this blog before. I modified <a href="/posts/fun-with-chatgpt/">the search of my posts from yesterday&rsquo;s post</a> to look for the word Pilates<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and it only came up once in <a href="/posts/ambitions-revisited/">a post about revisiting my ambitions ten years on</a>.</p>
<p>There I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I haven’t taken up meditation at all because the inside of my head is way too noisy. What I did do (at Ingrid’s suggestion) is take up Pilates: I swear by it now. It’s not quite the same as meditation but I’ve found the improvements to my core strength to be quite useful for my mental health.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p>For my blog I have a folder called posts. In that folder are more folders that are named for the slug of each post, as per the conventions of the Hugo static site generator. Those folders each contain a markdown file named index.md, each of which has a YAML header. Draft posts have a YAML key called draft which has the value true. Please can you write me a shell script that I can run from the directory above posts that tells me which folders in the posts folder contain draft posts?</p></p>

        <p><p>2025 might be a tough year, but I am going to try and blog every day. It means that now and then I might be writing a post like this one, where I am writing for the sake of continuing the streak. If I find myself doing that too often then I will take the hint and stop trying!</p>
<p>This weekend was the 3rd round of the FA Cup, which is when the premier league and championship teams enter the competition. This is the first time for quite a few years where Portsmouth have entered at this stage. Naturally, they&rsquo;re already out! Mind you, in recent years when they&rsquo;ve entered at the first round they haven&rsquo;t made it past those rounds either. That was bad news for one pub in Portsmouth which always made a big show of not taking down their Christmas decorations until Pompey were out of the FA Cup!</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 10, 2025</p>
        <p><p><a href="https://bolispupul.bandcamp.com">Bolis Pupul</a> (the stage name of Boris Zeebroek) is an artist on <a href="https://deew.ee/catalogue">Soulwax&rsquo;s Deewee label</a>. <a href="https://deew.ee/catalogue/074">&ldquo;Letter to Yu&rdquo;</a> is his debut album, inspired by a trip to Hong Kong to investigate his family history. It investigates themes of place, family, and identity. We are exposed to everywhere all at once but we&rsquo;re also all <em>from</em> somewhere, even if it&rsquo;s somewhere we might not recommend or understand.</p>
<p>Aside from the theme of the album, it&rsquo;s a satisfying and varied electronic album. You have a pop song early on in &ldquo;Completely Half&rdquo; (&ldquo;I thought that I / would fit right in / I&rsquo;m on the border of the state I&rsquo;m in&rdquo;) but the rest of side one is fine electro, peaking with the frenetic &ldquo;Doctor Says&rdquo; and ebbing out with the ringing &ldquo;Spicy Crab&rdquo;. (I realised writing this that the vinyl omits &ldquo;Frogs&rdquo; from the streaming version, but this makes the vinyl version of the album better paced.)</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 9, 2025</p>
        <p><p>&ldquo;Tiger&rsquo;s Blood&rdquo; is a glorious bundle of songs that writhe with brains and heart, with love and friendship, and many other complements and opposites. The music is mostly alternative AOR with a distinct country twang. The lyrics were pretty impenetrable to me, at least until I looked them up online (and they&rsquo;re also on the back of the poster that came with the LP), but they&rsquo;re mostly songs of hope and happiness. It was satisfying to listen to an album this care-free, even if there is a hint of darker times in the background.</p></p>
