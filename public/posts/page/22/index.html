        <p>Jun. 30, 2013</p>
        <p><p>Just two albums this month as I am still enjoying last month&rsquo;s albums so much (and I spent loads of time getting reacquainted with Boards Of Canada at the start of the month). I listened to a few more albums but not often enough to write loads about them so there is an &ldquo;honourable mention&rdquo; section at the end of the post that briefly discusses a few more albums.</p>
<p>Without further ado, the two albums are:</p></p>

        <p>Jun. 26, 2013</p>
        <p><p>Peter Ackroyd&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hawksmoor&rdquo; was first published in 1985. I bought a recent reissue that forms part of Penguin&rsquo;s decades collection whilst on a spree in Waterstone&rsquo;s. It appealed to me as I recently realised that despite growing up in the eighties and nineties, I had read very novels that were either written or set in the eighties. Happily &ldquo;Hawksmoor&rdquo; is both of these, sort of. It also appealed to me because it is (again, sort of) a detective story and I&rsquo;ve found myself getting into those lately. John Squire&rsquo;s excellent artwork for the cover and the nice binding also helped to seal the deal: you don&rsquo;t get that with an iPad or a Kindle.</p></p>

        <p>Jun. 24, 2013</p>
        <p><p>I have written a lot in these posts about how music gets indelibly tied up with places, events and feelings. For me this album by Fanfarlo is tied up with all three of these. It makes me happy and sad at the same time in memory of great times that are now gone but are fondly remembered. I am aware that this is the youngest album on the list so far and so it might be a bit early to endow classic status upon it, but &ldquo;Reservoir&rdquo; is a fine album and to my ears it stands up really well. Listening to it again in the course of writing this post I found that I remembered every note and musical phrase, and yet somehow I also managed to delight in hearing new features in the production that I&rsquo;d not noticed before.</p></p>

        <p>Jun. 22, 2013</p>
        <p><p>Today I went to see the new Superman reboot <em>Man of Steel</em> with friends. I really enjoyed it, particularly the more reflective take on the superhero myth. Starting out with the fate of the planet Krypton, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0770828/"><em>Man of Steel</em></a> approximately fuses the events of both the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078346/?ref_=sr_2">first</a> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081573/">two</a> original Superman movies. We get to see Superman&rsquo;s arrival and childhood on earth and then the arrival of Zod, a maniac bent on replacing the earth and everyone on it with a new race of Kryptonians.</p></p>

<p>You might remember that last year <a href="album-digest-february-2012">I reviewed the first Lilacs &amp; Champagne album</a> and I liked it a lot. This album sees them back with more of the same: taking the approach that if it ain&rsquo;t broke, don&rsquo;t fix it. There are very few changes to the formula apart from the fact that the spoken word samples are not quite as good this time and there&rsquo;s a bit more Grails-like guitar solo action.</p></p>

        <p>May. 29, 2013</p>
        <p><p>Today I went to see &ldquo;George Bellows 1882-1925 Modern American Life&rdquo; <a href="http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibitions/george-bellows/">at the Royal Academy of Arts</a>. It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve been to the RA but I was emboldened by my art pass and the fact that Bellows was a contemporary of Edward Hopper, a painter whom I admire greatly. This is the first major retrospective of Bellows&rsquo; work in the UK and taking in his wonderful paintings this afternoon, I felt a little embarrassed that I hadn&rsquo;t seen anything of his before.</p></p>

        <h1><a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/choucair-at-tate-modern/" title="Choucair At Tate Modern">Choucair At Tate Modern</a></h1>
        <p>May. 25, 2013</p>
        <p><p>Yesterday I went to see the Saloua Raouda Choucair show at the Tate Modern. As it was quite small, I went to see <a href="/lichtenstein-at-tate-modern/">the Lichtenstein show</a> again as well.</p>
<p>Choucair is an underrated Lebanese artist and many of the paintings and sculptures shown were created in the fifties and sixties. Her sculptures in particular are amazing.</p>
<p>The first room is lined with paintings that were nearly all gouache on paper, about 40cm by 30cm. These paintings were vibrant and abstract. I prefer larger oil paintings and it took me a while to get to grips with the small format and the bright colours, but they are really quite wonderful: the colours swim and dance in front of you. I thought the nudes were particularly interesting, mainly because nudes are executed by almost every artist at some stage (there are some rather spotty ones by Lichtenstein for example) and are usually quite memorable &ndash; so seeing an artist&rsquo;s nudes can give you a point of relation to other artists. Choucair&rsquo;s nudes are pink and ample and altogether the more charming for it.</p></p>

        <p>May. 23, 2013</p>
        <p><p>It was quite hard to choose an 808 State album for the <a href="understated-classics">understated classics series</a> for two reasons. The first is that I was introduced to 808 State quite late through a friend&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s cassette copy of The Shamen&rsquo;s En-Tact (the original version recorded from vinyl that had a thirteen minute version of &ldquo;Evil Is Eden&rdquo;) that also had &ndash; to fill out the C90 &ndash; the full length sweary version of &ldquo;What Time Is Love?&rdquo; by The KLF and four tracks: &ldquo;Cubik&rdquo;, &ldquo;Pacific&rdquo;, &ldquo;Olympic&rdquo; (I think&hellip;), and &ldquo;In Yer Face&rdquo;.</p></p>

        <p>May. 21, 2013</p>
        <p><p>This was a show that I had put off going to see for quite a while now. Looking online at the pictures featured in the show did not really excite me enough to get out and see it. I&rsquo;d seen <em>Whaam!</em> before in isolation (it&rsquo;s part of the Tate collection and will no doubt return once the retrospective show is over) and it didn&rsquo;t really grab me, arresting as it is. However, with plenty of free time this week it was an ideal time to go see it and I was happy to be proved wrong.</p></p>

        <p>May. 20, 2013</p>
        <p><p>&ldquo;The Marriage Plot&rdquo; by Jeffrey Eugenides is a novel about love and growing up set in the privileged world of US academia in the early eighties. The main plot concerns a love triangle involving two guys and a girl. Madeline Hanna, the girl at the apex of the love triangle, is the main focus of the novel and the majority of the novel is told from her standpoint. I think her sections are incredibly well written but I&rsquo;d love the thoughts of a female reader, in case it is actually all a horribly male way of seeing through a young woman&rsquo;s eyes. In love with Madeline (and the guy that we meet first) is Mitchell Grammaticus, an overly deep guy who is terribly concerned about whether he is doing the right thing in the world. He thinks that religious studies is for him but later finds that it is harder to live up to your ideals than you first imagine.</p></p>

        <p><p>I saw <em>Star Trek: Into Darkness</em> last night in 3D at the IMAX in Waterloo. I am going to have to separate this into a review into two parts, a review of the film and a review of the viewing experience. I am not completely happy with how the film experience is changed by the 3D and the super big screen and I will try to explain what I mean.</p></p>

<p>How you view <em>The Terror</em> pretty much depends on how much you have kept up with The Flips output since their last official album, the clanking double behemoth in Merkin packaging that was <em>Embryonic</em>. The irony being that I used <em>Embryonic</em> to deal with a break-up and <em>The Terror</em> is pretty much about&hellip; a break-up.</p></p>
