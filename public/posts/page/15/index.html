    <div><p>Perhaps in today&rsquo;s modern age of streaming and such, <a href="http://thecoral.co.uk">The Coral</a> would be a bigger band and may have survived their eventual burnout. Their work ethic was evident from the start, as rumours swirled <a href="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/YdkAAOSwfl9XBSiR/s-l300.jpg">in the NME</a> about a fantastic new band from Liverpool who were going to blow everybody&rsquo;s socks off. I went to see them live in Bristol after they&rsquo;d released three EPs and they were incredible. Their sound, a bit like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071615/">the movie &ldquo;Holy Mountain&rdquo;</a> set to pop music, imagined a Merseybeat channelled from an alternative universe in which Lennon and McCartney took their acid in <a href="https://www.desertusa.com/mojave-desert.html">the Mojave desert</a> rather than in the English suburbs. Yes, it was derivative but somehow it also managed to be utterly new and compelling.</p></div>

We started by heading out on route 1, which is like Iceland&rsquo;s M25 except that it encircles an entire country <em>and</em> about thirty times fewer people. We went to house of Nobel Prize winner Halldór Laxness, only to be turned away because it was being renovated and wouldn&rsquo;t open for another month. Undeterred, we pressed on toward <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Eingvellir">Þingvellir</a>, stopping off on the way to take pictures at a viewpoint. It was just crazy, a flat expanse of undisturbed snow. Just as with the drive from the airport, the territory should have been relentlessly bleak but instead we got a winter wonderland.</p></div>

I was instantly drawn in as I listened to the opening scene about an archaeological dig facing evacuation ahead of an imminent &lsquo;razor storm&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Revelation Space&rdquo; is <a href="http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/hard_sf">hard sci-fi</a> set in a universe where the speed of light cannot be exceeded. Most of the action takes place in the 26th century, with the narrative also recounting earlier events as the story progresses. Humanity has expanded to five or six systems beyond our current solar system, using huge colony ships that travel at 99.9% of the speed of light. This means that <a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/everyday-myths/relativity10.htm">relativistic effects</a> play an important role in the narrative. A lot is made of the difference between sleeping away the decades between star systems and subjectively experiencing them.</p></div>

As such the city was still under at least six inches of snow. We collected the hire car from the airport and drove out of Keflavik. The scenery normally looks like a moonscape, but for us it was a frosty white wonderland.</p>
<p><img /assets/images/iceland/iceland_01.jpg alt=""></p>
<p>After about an hour&rsquo;s drive, we arrived at the Hotel Nattura. From the outside it looks like a huge secondary school but as soon as you step inside it&rsquo;s warm and comfortable. This is quite good when you&rsquo;ve just parked next to a snow bank that&rsquo;s two and half metres tall and then bambi&rsquo;d it in over the icy paths with your luggage.</p></div>

However, it turned out to be a hoot. A couple of years ago, this novel would have been a wig-out bit of standard Ballard weirdness (a bit like <a href="the-drowned-world">&ldquo;The Drowned World&rdquo;</a> or <a href="the-crystal-world">&ldquo;The Crystal World&rdquo;</a>) but given recent events &ldquo;Hello America&rdquo; is starting to take on an eerie prescience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello America&rdquo; (1981) is set a hundred years from now in an alternate time-line where oil production peaked in the late sixties. Without a viable energy supply the North American continent depopulates and the Russians dam the Bering strait in order to turn Siberia into farmland to feed the American refugees. Meanwhile, the continental United States turns into a desert wasteland due to the resulting climate change. The 44th president (President Brown) was the last before America depopulated entirely.</p></div>

<p>We&rsquo;d like to thank everyone who nonetheless sent cards and gifts, and to all of those who wished us well on Facebook. Much as I&rsquo;m wary of social networks this did seem to be one of those events to which an announcement on Facebook was well suited. We intend to have additional celebrations at some point in the near future so keep your eyes peeled. We&rsquo;re aware that our little dyad cannot be the only point where our families intersect. We hope to overcome that, but it is those sorts of complications that drove us to a smaller scale event in the first place. I&rsquo;m very keen on the &lsquo;win the lottery and hire a few private jets&rsquo; approach but they keep selling me faulty tickets.</p></div>

    <div><p>We bought a cheap package holiday in the British Airways Black Friday sale. The weekend spanned Ingrid&rsquo;s birthday, so it was ideal. £99 each for flights and a hotel, and we bagged a hire car quite cheaply too.</p>
<p>Because our flight was from Heathrow and the trains from Chichester are both expensive and inconvenient for early flights, we spoiled ourselves with a taxi to the airport. It felt very strange to be whisked through the Sussex and Surrey countryside at six am on a Friday morning!</p></div>

    <div><p>I came late to Orbital&rsquo;s work. I knew of them through a few remixes and because as a mad Orb fan, they could not have avoided my notice could they? Apart from that, one of my college friends tried to get me into &ldquo;In Sides&rdquo; just after its release in 1996. The same friend got me into <a href="/understated-classics-11/">&ldquo;Second Toughest In The Infants&rdquo; by Underworld</a>. I cannot now understand the reason, but &ldquo;In Sides&rdquo; just left me cold.</p></div>
