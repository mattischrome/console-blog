My flight left London early and I had a three hour stopover in Madrid, then a twelve hour flight onward to Quito. My bag didn&rsquo;t leave Madrid though, so we were separated for about twenty four nerve-racking hours. Luckily, I&rsquo;d packed a change of clothes and so I was still able to explore Quito with Lee and Miriam (fellow Tucan travellers) the next day without too much discomfort.</p></div>

<p>I first got into CHVRCHES on Record Store Day, one of my purchases was an Irn Bru coloured 12&quot; of the Recover EP that, according to eBay, tripled in value over night. Judging by this, their full debut, my see-through orange slab of happiness may hold its value, because it&rsquo;s clear that CHVRCHES should be around for the long haul. &ldquo;The Bones Of What You Believe&rdquo; is a master class in upbeat pop songwriting that doesn&rsquo;t have to pander to the lowest common denominator.</p></div>

The modification I have made for this recipe is to omit the espresso but I will point out where it should be added, in case you want to give that a try.</p></div>

<p>I planned this post as a follow-up to one called <a href="/the-truth-about-work/">The Truth About Work</a> from a couple of months ago, but a few things happened that changed my thinking. It has implications for my future and in particular, it redefines what this break from work and upcoming trip means to me.</p>
<p>One of the punchlines to &ldquo;The Truth About Work&rdquo; was that, sometimes, the only way to move ahead is to quit. I originally put it a little more baldly: I said that you <em>always</em> have to quit in order to move on from a sticky situation. Because I knew I was about to quit, I felt I had to write about that decision in unequivocal terms. Obviously I don&rsquo;t think that you should just tap out every single time that things get a little tough. I am not even sure now whether I should have done it at all: hitting the reset button so far in advance of the tour no longer feels like the great idea that it once did. I wasted a lot of the last six weeks and the principal effect of that has been to erode my self-esteem and my bank account.</p></div>

It&rsquo;s an interesting, if uneven, affair that entertains but doesn&rsquo;t quite succeed in everything it attempts to do. The big word that you learn is iconoclasm: the act of attacking an object believed to represent particular beliefs. The show splits into two parts: ideological acts of iconoclasm committed against works of art in Britain and the work of British artists who embrace iconoclasm as a means for making art. The first half (comprising more than half of the show - because I lump together two of the shows sections &ldquo;Religion&rdquo; and &ldquo;Politics&rdquo; into this half) is more interesting and successful than the second (&ldquo;Aesthetics&rdquo;).</p></div>

For a book that I had trouble getting into, it turned out to be a pretty good read - even if it was also a pretty unpleasant one. Published in 1975, &ldquo;High-Rise&rdquo; is perhaps ahead of its time in exploring the effects of social breakdown in stylised and artificial situations where people are in close contact. You might think the plot, about a luxury high-rise that goes to hell, is in some way political or sociological but it really isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s just a big playground in which Ballard throws around some of his most twisted ideas, all the while remarking on the very artifice of the situation.</p></div>

In fact before &ldquo;AM&rdquo;, I already had two (ripped from the CDs of friends) but had never bothered to listen to them.</p></div>

<p>&ldquo;Long Gone Before Daylight&rdquo; (&ldquo;Long Gone Before Daylight&rdquo;) plays the role of &ldquo;The Empire Strikes Back&rdquo; in a trilogy of great albums that The Cardigans released between 1999 (the arguably better and slightly happier &ldquo;Gran Turismo&rdquo;) and 2006 (the unarguably inferior and definitely happier &ldquo;Super Extra Gravity&rdquo;). &ldquo;Long Gone Before Daylight&rdquo; has more of a country sound than &ldquo;Gran Turismo&rdquo; or &ldquo;Super Extra Gravity&rdquo;, which meant that I ignored it for a long time: until the disintegration and failure of several relationships convinced me of its brilliance.</p></div>

    <div><p>For reasons that will become apparent, there will be a short period soon where I will not be writing album digests. Until then, I&rsquo;m clearing a backlog of some albums that I&rsquo;ve been listening to but haven&rsquo;t had enough time or motivation to write about. Only one of this month&rsquo;s albums was released this month, something that&rsquo;s not that uncommon at this time of the year as it is not the best time to release things.

<p>Motivation is a fickle thing. You can see it in action here on this blog, or rather in inaction as there are often &ldquo;<a href="/articles/the-drought/">droughts</a>&rdquo; between posts (and draughts between drafts&hellip;). Back in June I tried to write a post each day that had a title of the form &ldquo;X and Y&rdquo;. I was overambitious and they petered out after a bit. This was one of those posts and was originally titled &ldquo;Motivation and Lies&rdquo; in melodramatic fashion. I came back to the original draft this evening and quite liked it; so I rewrote the introduction, cut out some of the swears, and rounded out the conclusion a bit.</p></div>
