        <p><h2 id="or-at-least-its-subversive-soundtrack">Or at least its subversive soundtrack…</h2>
<p>I listened to The Orb’s amazing live album “Live ’93” the other day (after discovering the insipid “History Of The Future” collection on Spotify) and I was amazed at how countercultural and subversive it was. I was listening to this stuff at the age of 14 and now that I’m old enough to be a parent, that makes me a bit uncomfortable. Actually it does nothing of the sort, because it&rsquo;s frigging awesome.</p></p>

        <p><blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you about punk rock: punk rock is a word used by dilettantes and ah&hellip; and ah&hellip; heartless manipulators about music that takes up the energies and the bodies and the hearts and the souls and the time and the minds of young men who give what they have to it and give everything they have to it and it&rsquo;s a&hellip; it&rsquo;s a term that&rsquo;s based on contempt, it&rsquo;s a term that&rsquo;s based on fashion, style, elitism, satanism and everything that&rsquo;s rotten about rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; roll. I don&rsquo;t know <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_Lydon">Johnny Rotten</a> but I&rsquo;m sure&hellip; I&rsquo;m sure he puts as much blood and sweat into what he does as <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud">Sigmund Freud</a> did. You see, what sounds to you like a big load of trashy old noise is in fact the brilliant music of a genius, myself . And that music is so powerful that it&rsquo;s quite beyond my control and ah&hellip; when I&rsquo;m in the grips of it I don&rsquo;t feel pleasure and I don&rsquo;t feel pain, either physically or emotionally. Do you understand what I&rsquo;m talking about? Have you ever felt like that? When you just couldn&rsquo;t feel anything and you didn&rsquo;t want to either. You know? Like that? Do you understand what I&rsquo;m saying sir? (Iggy Pop, Canadian TV, March 11th 1977.)</p></p>

        <p>Jul. 3, 2014</p>
        <p><p>The hat in question is a Wilco baseball cap that I bought at a gig of theirs in 2004, the night that Germany got eliminated from Euro 2004. I&rsquo;d love to show you a picture of it but I can&rsquo;t, there isn&rsquo;t even a picture of it from a Wilco merch site: at least not one that Google or Bing images can see anyway. I did manage to find a side-on picture of it in my bedroom in 2005 and zoom right in on it like they do in CSI.</p></p>

        <p><p><a href="http://temporaryresidence.com/artists/watter">Watter</a> are a &ldquo;supergroup&rdquo; composed from various members of Grails, <a href="http://touchandgorecords.com/bands/band.php?id=70">Slint</a>, and other bands. I did not know anything about Hundred Waters before this month: &ldquo;The Moon Rang Like A Bell&rdquo; is their second album. In fact second albums by bands I know nothing about are a something of theme because &ldquo;Sunbathing Animal&rdquo; is Parquet Courts&rsquo; sophomore effort and I don&rsquo;t know anything about them either. Meanwhile, I&rsquo;ve meant to write about &ldquo;The Four Seasons Recomposed&rdquo; since April.</p></p>

        <p>May. 31, 2014</p>
        <p><p>This month was strange. I didn’t listen to much new music and after <a href="/album-digest-april-2014/">last month’s bumper digest</a> there’s probably a reason for that. Not to mention that Spotify gives you more reasons to look backwards than forwards. Nevertheless, this brief post features new albums by Little Dragon and Coldplay, along with the mini-album collaboration between Röyskopp and Robyn.</p>
<h2 id="little-dragon-nabuma-rubberband">Little Dragon “Nabuma Rubberband”</h2>
<p>I discovered Little Dragon, like most people, I imagine, via Gorillaz’ “Plastic Beach” album. When I investigated their “Machine Dreams” album I was surprised that their sound had transplanted to “Plastic Beach” intact. Sometimes you discover a band through a collaboration and their own work turns out to be disappointing, somehow diminished by the other artist(s) no longer being present. “Machine Dreams” is a fine album that breezes by, much like “Empire Ants” and “To Binge” do on “Plastic Beach”.</p></p>

        <p>Apr. 15, 2014</p>
        <p><p>I am thinking about whether I want to use Dropbox to sync my files anymore. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love Dropbox. It came along in beta in just 2008 just as I needed it to manage my PhD thesis. In fact I often jokingly claim to having invented it by asking on the MacRumors forums whether a program like it existed  - just a few weeks before its beta rode in to my life like a knight in shining armour. I recognised the need for a service that would synchronise a single directory and its contents between multiple computers using The Power Of The Internet™. I was used to using commands like scp to maintain my static blog on the university&rsquo;s servers and the multiple computers that I authored it from, though in 2008 when I moved back to my parents&rsquo; house to write up my PhD I was frustrated that I couldn&rsquo;t work out how to do the same things when the target was a PC running Windows XP.</p></p>

        <p>Mar. 31, 2014</p>
        <p><p>I’m back in the UK so it’s back to posts about albums each month. This one is a bit different because I didn’t listen to very much new stuff while I was away so not all of the albums are up to date. I had to write about the new album by Liars though because it&rsquo;s awesome and I couldn&rsquo;t wait to discuss it! Here’s the list of albums:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tegan and Sarah <em>Heartthrob</em></li>
<li>Fanfarlo <em>Let&rsquo;s Go Extinct</em></li>
<li>Liars <em>Mess</em></li>
<li>London Grammar <em>If You Wait</em></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="tegan-and-sarah-_heartthrob_">Tegan and Sarah <em>Heartthrob</em></h2>
<p>I would argue, as I have throughout my sequence of <a href="/tags#understated-classics/">understated classics</a> posts, that a great album is one that changes you as a person. Sometimes an album changes your mood consistently, sometimes an album makes you think about the experiences in your life differently, and sometimes an album is just so great and comes along at just the right time to knock you for six. I’d say that in 2014 Tegan and Sara’s “Heartthrob” has been that album for me.</p></p>

        <p><p>Arequipa and Cusco &ndash; the two cities that are the subject of this post &ndash; are probably the two cities in Peru that are most amenable to travellers (though Lima certainly has a lot to offer too). For me they should have been punctuated with a trip to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colca_Canyon">Colca canyon</a>, one of the deepest canyons in the world and twice as deep as the Grand Canyon. Unfortunately, I got really sick on the second day in Arequipa as my attempts at keeping my tummy bug at bay finally failed. (Even so, I didn&rsquo;t actually seek any proper medical help till the second day in Cusco, I was pretty boneheaded about it.)</p></p>

        <p><p>Next up was a piecemeal section of the trip that took in a varied set of sights and helped us get to know the new passengers who joined in Lima. On the first day we took a boat trip out to the Ballestas Islands, a nature reserve that is informally known as “the poor man’s galapagos”. Living there are penguins, sea birds, sea lions and seals. The speed boat out was a little wet and wild (and in fact the return trip was even wetter and wilder) so we all got soaked (twice) but the microclimate around the islands themselves was calm and warm, and we all got good value out of our cameras (if they still worked that is). We even saw a pelican get taken down by a sea-lion which was an interesting if not altogether pleasant display of nature red in tooth and claw. Also, who knew that guano was so valuable?!?</p></p>

        <p><p>From Punta Sal we took a long driving down to Huanchaco, via a stop off at the Lord of Saipan museum. The lord of Saipan is a Moche mummy found dressed in all manner of gold and surrounded by artefacts and other sacrifices (including other humans and decapitated llamas). The tour took a while to get going (our guide was late) but the exhibition was so amazing (the pieces were painstakingly restored in Germany) that it was hugely enjoyable. The diorama at the end featuring moving animatronic waxworks of Moche people was extremely weird though.</p></p>

        <p><p>After Cuenca we set off for the Peruvian border. One of the great advantages of having a UK passport in South America is that you don&rsquo;t need any visas. If you&rsquo;re Australian or Canadian it&rsquo;s a different story. Nevertheless we all got over the border with very little trouble (the third ever land border crossing of my life) apart from the bits where they seem to make you wait in a queue just for the sake of making you wait in a queue.</p></p>
