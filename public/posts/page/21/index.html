        <p><p>We hear a lot about our rights but these are given to us in return for fulfilling our responsibilities. One of these is engagement in the democratic process, and in particular voting. You should register to vote, that’s a no brainer. You should take an interest in what politics means for you locally, nationally, and internationally. On the day you to get to the polling station and cast your vote. Then you need to hold you representative accountable afterwards, even if he or she isn’t the person you voted for.</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 31, 2015</p>
        <p><p>Album Digest January 2015 rounds up a few albums from the tail end of 2014 that I didn&rsquo;t get much time to write about. The only one of these six to be released this month is the excellent &ldquo;No Cities To Love&rdquo; by Sleater-Kinney.</p>
<h2 id="sleater-kinney-no-cities-to-love">Sleater-Kinney &ldquo;No Cities To Love&rdquo;</h2>
<p>I had heard of Sleater-Kinney before their boxed set “Start Together” was released in 2014. I was quite impressed that they curated their own Spotify playlist with the contents of the box. I added it and even downloaded the songs for offline listening but didn’t get around to much more than a cursory play of a few tracks.</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 18, 2015</p>
        <p><p>One of the first lines of &ldquo;The House That Guilt Built&rdquo;, the soft cricket-laden lament that opens The Meadowlands by The Wrens, is &ldquo;I&rsquo;m nowhere near where I thought I&rsquo;d be&rdquo;. The last line of the whole album is &ldquo;this is not what you had planned&rdquo;. These bookending lines set the tone for this shimmering, ramshackle masterpiece - a fatigue and careworn pride in failing to meet impossible standards writ large over its first and last eighty or so seconds. &ldquo;The Meadowlands&rdquo; is probably the best record you&rsquo;ve never heard, and once you have heard it, you will never be the same. Even better, it changes and you change with every single listen. If you&rsquo;re living your life and you really mean it, then this is the record for you.</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 3, 2015</p>
        <p><p>Feersum Endjinn is one of Iain Banks&rsquo; few non-Culture sci-fi novels. Like the Culture novels, an existential crisis drives the plot: in this case the action takes place on Earth in the far future and the sun has aged to a point where it will grow and swallow the earth. This is referred to as the Encroachment. The characters are divided between the good guys who seek to find a solution for the greater good and bad guys who use the Encroachment to consolidate their power and influence.</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 1, 2015</p>
        <p><p>Just a brief message to wish everyone a happy new year. Getting my flat connected to the internet continues to be a trial so it&rsquo;s still not as easy to post as I would like. However, I have some workarounds now and I hope to write (and post) more often from now on.</p>
<p>Like everyone I make resolutions at this time of year, though as the years pass I realise that the best resolutions are to apopt a new way of being rather than a new way of doing. I find it quite difficult to &ldquo;change&rdquo; myself by willpower alone. I think this is true of most people. Travelling taught me that it&rsquo;s better to evolve. I just do one little thing differently and then try to notice the benefits as they accrue. As you become are of how you are changing it gets easier and you can shift your focus to doing another little thing a bit differently, a bit better. At least that&rsquo;s the theory.</p></p>

        <p>Dec. 30, 2014</p>
        <p><p>Overlong reflection upon the past is one sure way to make yourself unhappy so I try to avoid it. Nevertheless it becomes unavoidable at this time of year, especially if, like me, you are somewhat prone to reflection.</p>
<p>At this time last year I was, <a href="/articles/south-america-trip-part-11/">as detailed in the most recent report of my South American adventure</a>, in La Paz, Bolivia. I think I felt as lost then as I do now, though back then I had the novelty of new places and good friends to steer me through. This year I find myself stuck in an expensive flat that I can hardly afford to heat in a city where I hardly know anyone: it seems ridiculous that I had more people around me in La Paz than I do here but there you go.</p></p>

        <p><p>I recently started a new job and moved in to a new flat. This means I&rsquo;m too busy to write any long blog posts at the moment. Also I&rsquo;m still not quite at home there, so I tend to spend my evenings tidying up or setting up new things. It&rsquo;s a shame because I have plenty of things to write about (even without observations on moving, starting a new job, etc) but I guess the writing will happen eventually&hellip;</p></p>

He was working on it when he committed suicide in 2008. It was compiled from incomplete notes and released posthumously in 2011.

        <p>Sep. 30, 2014</p>
        <p><p>Album Digest September 2014 contains four amazing albums, including the long-awaited return from the Aphex Twin, and an album from Cymbals Eat Guitars released about a week after I wondered what had happened to them. Spooky. Rounding out the selection this month are a cool punky-disco album by The Juan Maclean and a truly remarkable offering by Vessel.</p>
<h2 id="aphex-twin-syro">Aphex Twin <em>SYRO</em></h2>
<p><em>SYRO</em> is the sixth album by Aphex Twin and his first official Aphex Twin release since Drukqs in 2001. Announced with a typically cryptic track listing at a month&rsquo;s notice via the dark web, along with artwork that resembles a tax receipt for the costs of releasing the album, his anarchic streak appears intact. Therefore the most suprising thing about SYRO is just how conventional it sounds on first listen.</p></p>

        <p>Sep. 25, 2014</p>
        <p><p>This post deals with how to generate random numbers in R. It is good to know how to generate random numbers with a particular language or software package for at least one of the following three reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>You want to test something that depends on a particular distribution.</li>
<li>You’re running a stochastic process of some kind (Branching process, random walk etc) and you need random numbers for deciding whether an event occurs.</li>
<li>You forgot to pick your lottery numbers this week.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s step through doing each of these with R. Over time I will write this post out again for C++, Java, Python, and Ruby. This post is just a memory aid that I can use later on and is not meant as anything more rigorous than that. As such it is a living document, I will mutate this post in place as and when I need to. Memory aids are useful for when you haven’t used a particular programming language or software package for a while. Who knows, it might save me a couple of searches with DuckDuckGo.</p></p>

        <p>Sep. 2, 2014</p>
        <p><p>I recently finished reading <em>All The Birds, Singing</em>, the second novel by <a href="http://www.eviewyld.com">Evie Wyld</a>. It’s about a woman called Jake who lives alone on a farm with a dog called Dog on an island somewhere off the coast of Britain. She has sheep to look after but something keeps coming in the middle of the night to kill them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as the narrative on the island moves forward in the present, a second narrative peels off backwards to explain her past. This takes place in Australia. Jake is still working with sheep but there is a confrontation with a fellow farmhand who threatens to expose a secret from her past. As this second strand unfurls, we begin to see why Jake is jumpy and convinced that the deaths of her sheep represent ill-portent. However, because this second story rolls backwards in jumps, we have to wait until the end for the terrible events that set her on this path.</p></p>

        <p><p>The album digest returns with five albums by four artists.</p>
<ol>
<li>Karl Hyde &amp; Brian Eno <em>Someday World</em> &amp; <em>HIGH-LIFE</em></li>
<li>Lone <em>Reality Testing</em></li>
<li>FKA twigs <em>LP1</em></li>

</ol>
<h2 id="karl-hyde--brian-eno-someday-world--high-life">Karl Hyde &amp; Brian Eno <em>Someday World</em> &amp; <em>HIGH-LIFE</em></h2>
<p>I’m a big fan of both Karl Hyde’s work with Underworld and of Brian Eno’s stuff so Someday World seemed like a dream collaboration to me when it was released last May. I was a bit underwhelmed by it, to the point of overlooking it for <a href="/album-digest-may-2014/">May’s album digest</a>. Last month they released a follow-up called High-Life, which includes some of the more experimental tracks they’d worked on. Together the two albums are greater than the some of their parts, so I’m writing about both of them together this month.</p></p>
