        <p>Jul. 31, 2012</p>
        <p><p>Just a short album digest this month. I bought a stack of CDs and am parcelling them out over the next few months (together with important additional releases as they crop up). This is in the hope that I can write more considered pieces about each one. This month I’ve grouped together albums with monochrome covers and a BT album from June that I found out about recently. These albums are not just linked by their artwork, they also form a cohesive whole. As a result I dispense with reviewing each album in depth. As usual there is a playlist at the end.</p></p>

        <p>Jun. 30, 2012</p>
        <p><p>Three fantastic albums for Album Digest June 2012:</p>
<ol>
<li>Saint Etienne <em>Words and Music by Saint Etienne</em></li>
<li>Liars <em>WIXIW</em></li>
<li>Hot Chip <em>In Our Heads</em></li>
</ol>
<p>This month is a curious selection in that the albums are all by bands that I already own a few records by. When there is so much other directly related material that you can write about, it makes focussing on the album in hand quite difficult. I am always thinking up rankings and comparisons. Where does this new album fit in with the rest of them? Will I like it as much when the novelty wears off? What would it sound like if they had done Y or Z like they did back on album X?</p></p>

        <p><p>This post is about the films of Wes Anderson. I am no expert, I’ve just watched them all recently (inspired by <a href="moonrise-kingdom-a-short-review">seeing “Moonrise Kingdom”</a>) and spotted a some similarities and differences between the films and I thought it would be fun to write about them. My appearance on Mastermind with “The Films of Wes Anderson” as my specialist subject will have to wait for now. Feel free to add to the discussion in the comments. In case you don’t know what the films are, here they are in order (with links to their IMDB pages):</p></p>

        <p>Jun. 25, 2012</p>
        <p><p>As indicated by my <a href="articles/reading-list-mid-april-2012">reading list</a> posted a couple of months ago (which has since been added to <a href="articles/another-reading-list">here</a>), I’ve started to try to read more about the things that I felt that I did not understand so well. Most notably perhaps is this book “on love” by Helen Fisher. Lest there is any innuendo it is not a book about technique nor does it attempt to explain love to those who have never known it, instead it assumes that we have all been there. In fact, the book attempts to explain the neurological mechanisms of love (specifically romantic love) and describes how science has helped reveal these mechanisms to us.</p></p>

<p>More books to add to the “University of life” course list. From top to bottom: I picked up “Generation X” for 50p in a charity shop in Tintagel. “Everything Is Going To Be OK” is a picture book full of inspirational mottos. “The Happiness Hypothesis” is the most useful and interesting book that I have read in a long while. I decided to read “How To Write A Sentence” as an alternative to Strunk and White’s “The Elements Of Style” which, while useful, can be a little stuffy! “The Marriage Plot” is a novel with interesting reviews, it was also (ahem) well-priced. After love I decided to go after music as something else I wanted to read about, hence “The Music Instinct” which comes highly recommended. “The Gifts Of Imperfection” is a manifesto for embracing life in a wholehearted way. And “Gonzo”? Well, <a href="/gonzo-a-graphic-biography-of-hunter-s-thompson/">I have written about that one already</a>.</p></p>

        <p>Jun. 24, 2012</p>
        <p><p>This arrived on Monday and I thought I would give it a post of its own because at over 3 hours of music, I am unlikely to do more than dip into it before writing the album digest next week. It is a far bigger and more enjoyable artefact than I thought it was going to be, so it probably deserves special attention for that reason too.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_(band)">CAN</a> are a German (“<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krautrock">Krautrock</a>”) band that I got into about four years ago after my interest in the genre was sparked by the “Neu! 75” album and the Kraftwerk box set. I have four of CAN&rsquo;s albums and I have thought about which one I should include as an <a href="understated-classics">understated classic</a>. It will probably be “Soon Over Babaluma” because no one really writes about that one. Then again, Portishead’s “Third” probably wouldn’t sound as awesome as it does without the influence of “Ege Bamyasi”, so that might be worth considering too. Everyone writes about “Tago Mago” and “Future Days” but for good reason.</p></p>

        <p><p>Another book from the “university of life” pile (though <a href="reading-list-mid-april-2012">not in the picture</a>), “Gonzo” is the biography of Hunter S. Thompson in graphical form. In case you don’t know his work, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_S._Thompson">Hunter S. Thompson</a> was a journalist who invented the so-called “gonzo” style. This was basically to rock up at some major event and become embedded within it, usually writing up a long form piece from an outsider perspective. He was particularly famous for his work on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell%27s_Angels:_The_Strange_and_Terrible_Saga_of_the_Outlaw_Motorcycle_Gangs">Hell’s Angels</a> and Richard Nixon’s campaign for presidential re-election in 1972.</p></p>

        <p>Jun. 16, 2012</p>
        <p><p>Tonight I avoided the first half of the football along with my friend Albert Jan and we went to watch “Moonrise Kingdom” at the wonderful Everyman cinema in Hampstead. It was a real treat in every sense. To start with, the Everyman is a lovely cinema. It is quite expensive but you do get what you pay for: a comfortable seat in a great theatre and the chance to watch more than just the latest blockbusters (though it shows those too). I think it was the only cinema in my area that was showing <em>Moonrise Kingdom</em>, though it has been out for a while now.</p></p>

        <p><p>Say what? We’re allowing compilations now?</p>
<p>Yes. Why not? A good mix is as much an artistic statement as a full-blown single artist album. It takes a lot of skill to get from A to B and keep everything on the boil in between. <a href="http://www.fabriclondon.com/store/catalog/product/view/id/30/s/fabric-12/categories/8/">This Fabric mix by The Amalgamation Of Soundz</a> is one of my favourites because it is a downtempo (but, crucially, not <em>too</em> downtempo) compilation delivered with flair and using what I consider to be unconventional sources (soundtracks, tribute albums, hip-hop) to do it.</p></p>

        <p>May. 31, 2012</p>
        <p><p>Four albums for Album Digest May 2012:</p>
<ol>
<li>Jack White <em>Blunderbuss</em></li>
<li>One Little Plane <em>Into The Trees</em></li>
<li>Beach House <em>Bloom</em></li>
<li>Oxia <em>Tides Of Mind</em></li>
</ol>
<p>The <a href="album-digest-april-2012">April album digest</a> was rather short on songs, so this month I decided to look for albums that were more based around songs not tracks. Electronic music is relatively easy to write about: the music is often simple (but not always), there are recognisable structures and genres (but not always), and there are conventions that are adhered to (but not always). The repetition of those parenthetical “not always” means that while the writing is easy, it is also often quite fun.</p></p>

        <p><p>A mostly instrumental month with a comeback from Orbital, an excellent remix collection from Battles, an amazing movie documenting a live performance by the Chemical Brothers and Austin Wintory’s soundtrack to the game <em>Journey</em>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Orbital <em>Wonky</em></li>
<li>Battles <em>Dross Glop</em></li>
<li>The Chemical Brothers <em>Don’t Think</em></li>

</ol>
<h2 id="orbital-_wonky_">Orbital <em>Wonky</em></h2>
<p>I am quite keen on Orbital, though perhaps not as keen as I am on the similarly named Orb. I think I have got all the Orbital albums, mostly bought on eBay after the fact. (Funny story though, I did find a copy of <em>In Sides</em> in the loft of a house where I lived in Bath, along with several other albums…) My favourite Orbital album is probably <em>Snivilisation</em> but they all have their moments, whether it is the genuine sliver of emotion shot through <em>Halcyon</em> off the brown album, the proggy long-form tracks on <em>In Sides</em> like <em>The Girl With The Sun In Her Head</em> or <em>Out There Somewhere</em> (parts one and two), or indeed the arsing about with heavy metal samples on tracks like <em>Tension</em> off the highly underrated <em>The Altogether</em>.</p></p>
