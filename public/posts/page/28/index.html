        <p>Aug. 31, 2011</p>
        <p><p>I bought a collection of electronic music this month. I mixed them all up in a smart playlist on iTunes, the smart aspect being to limit to tracks that had been played fewer than five then six then seven times etc. This made sure I was still listening to all the tracks equally often, despite the randomness.</p>
<ol>
<li>Biosphere <em>N-plants</em></li>
<li>Ford &amp; Lopatin <em>Channel Pressure</em></li>
<li>Gus Gus <em>Arabian Horse</em></li>
<li>Instra:Mental <em>Resolution 653</em></li>
<li>Jon Tejada <em>Parabolas</em></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="biosphere-_n-plants_">Biosphere <em>N-Plants</em></h2>
<p>I think this album makes Biosphere the most reviewed musician on this blog at the moment but I don’t mind too much, he makes some great stuff. <em>N-Plants</em> is a series of pieces about Japanese nuclear power plants and was ready for release by about February this year, just before the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster">Fukishima nuclear disaster</a> in March. It ended up being released in June. I am not sure if this represents a delay or not but as this quote shows, <a href="http://www.touchmusic.org.uk/catalogue/to84_biosphere_nplants.html">Geir Jenssen is aware of how spooky the timing was</a>.</p></p>

<p>No matter how intellectual one gets about these things, the primary function of music is to have fun. With this in mind it is a good time to turn to Roxette then, as they are almost always the epitome of fun.</p>
<p>I received <em>Look Sharp!</em> as a present for my ninth birthday. This was probably a bit young to fully understand all the emotions expressed on the record. It’s just as well that it is also crammed with the kind of pop confections that made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Bore_Us,_Get_to_the_Chorus!">“Don’t bore us, get to the chorus!”</a> something of a band motto and made for a great introduction to the world of pop for a nine year old boy.</p></p>

        <h1><a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/five-lessons-from-a-year-of-blogging/" title="Five lessons from a year of blogging">Five lessons from a year of blogging</a></h1>
        <p>Aug. 5, 2011</p>
        <p><p>I have now been writing decent length articles on this site for about a year. I have learned a lot in this time, mostly about writing but also how to express your feelings and how to marshal your ideas and passions into action. For this month’s “five on the fifth”, I would like to share  with you some of the things I have learned.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Writing posts consistently is hard…</strong> There are a lot of things that get in the way of regular posting. Sometimes it is ambition undermines me, I have ideas for posts that are easy to think up that turn out to be much harder to actually write. Other times life does just get in the way, it is  a time-consuming activity to write five hundred or more words every day. I like to write posts out longhand before typing them up. I often find mistakes or horrible phrasing when I do this and often what seemed like a simple matter of typing something up becomes a bit of a mission. Of course, there are times when I am just lazy or uninspired.</li>
<li><strong>…except when it is easy.</strong> I discovered early on that having a few arcs through the posts was a good idea as it makes you think a few in advance about what to do next. I prefer to be a generalist but it is nice to have the movie reviews, the <a href="understated-classics">understated classics</a> and the <a href="j-g-ballard">JG Ballard</a> novels to fall back on. Truth be told I am a little bored of Ballard now but even if I retire that particular strand of posts (Spoiler: Don’t worry, <em>High-Rise</em> is on the way soon) I can always resume it later. Meanwhile, I can pad out the off days with some quotes or some photos.</li>
<li><strong>Easier to read is easier to write.</strong> I hope that the blog is easier to read now than when I started. I still find myself producing the odd clunky phrase now and then but the number of passive sentences is decreasing. The unexpected benefit of this has been that I find it easier to check earlier posts in search for inspiration about what to write next. Early on, I would often end up editing old posts into something more comprehensible instead of writing new material. The “After the Deadline” feature of <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jetpack/">Jetpack for WordPress</a> has been very helpful in training me to write better.</li>
<li><strong>WordPress is a lot of fun.</strong> The statistic is that <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> now powers about 500 million websites. It is not hard to see why, it is easy to install, easy to customise to suit to your tastes and most of all, it rewards you for continuing to produce content. I have installed all sorts of plug-ins, including a <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-word-count/">word count plug-in</a> that tells me that I have (up to this post) written a total of 89,032 published words. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_a_novel">If Wikipedia is to be believed</a>, that is about the length of a pretty long novel. At least now I know I could write a novel in a year even if it was a rather surreal one featuring a 10K run, spiders and an Apatosaurus.</li>
<li><strong>I still have a lot more to do, a lot more to learn.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2017-update">2017 Update</h3>
<p>Adding to this footnote some years later (2017) I realise that not all blog posts are permanent. Sometimes you write what you need to at the time and then take it down later. We don&rsquo;t have to be permanently changed by what we once wrote on a Wednesday afternoon.</p></p>

        <p>Jul. 31, 2011</p>
        <p><p>Quite a mixed bag this month.</p>
<ol>
<li>SBTRKT <em>SBTRKT</em></li>
<li>Zomby <em>Dedication</em></li>
<li>Brian Eno <em>Drums Between The Bells</em></li>
<li>Bon Iver <em>Bon Iver</em></li>
<li>Washed Out <em>Within and Without</em></li>
</ol>
<p>This month’s collection of albums is a rather mellow bunch. The SBTRKT album (self-titled) is probably the most frenetic of the five though even that does not exactly pound four to the floor. Most of it is pretty calm, though  the occasional burst of pop to spice things up: sometimes it is as downtempo as the rest (<em>Right Thing To Do</em> and <em>Trials Of The Past</em>) but at other times things spark into life, as on <em>Pharaohs</em>.</p></p>

<p>“I read the news today, oh boy”  (The Beatles, <em>A Day In The Life</em>.)</p>

<p>Sometimes watching the news feels like a series of repeated blows to the face: arbitrary, cruel and unrelenting. It gets draining and upsetting, and leaves you fearful of what might come next.</p>
<p>You won’t need me to tell you about the tragedies that have occurred all over the world in the last few days: drought in East Africa, the gunman running amok in Norway, the death of Amy Winehouse and the horrific train crash in China.</p></p>

        <p><h2 id="your-rails-your-fins-your-thin-paper-wings">Your rails, your fins, your thin paper wings</h2>
<p><em>Second Toughest in the Infants</em> (STITI) is the second album by Underworld, released in 1995. This was just ahead of the mania caused by the .NUXX version of Born Slippy appearing on the <em>Trainspotting</em> soundtrack a little later. <em>Born Slippy</em> itself, the blippy techno confection released between their début <em>Dubnobasswithmyheadman</em> and this album. STITI then is very much the calm before the storm and features a band (in the truest sense, which is unusual among electronic acts) in full flow. The sure hands are apparent from the off with the all-in-one trifecta of <em>Juanita</em>, <em>Kiteless</em> and <em>To Dream of Love</em>: a huge slab of a track that propels, mashes and then glides over various tempos in its sixteen minute run.</p></p>

        <p>Jul. 19, 2011</p>
        <p><p>Reading a few articles about the recent launch of Google+, a few things hit home. Google tends to launch a product that works and not always one that is perfect or finished (like, say, Apple). Sometimes it takes them several iterations to get right. They love the beta tag. In fact, I think it was Google (or possibly Flickr) that made me aware of the concept of beta software.</p>
<p>Along these line I thought about this blog and its one year anniversary. I take a similar approach here to posts on this blog, specifically in pushing out new categories now and then. I have done this in the hope that adding a new subject or thread will lead to me writing more posts. Currently I am averaging ten posts a month, which is not too bad.</p></p>

        <p>Jul. 12, 2011</p>
        <p><p>Just as with the <a href="understated-classics">understated classics</a> I want to set out my stall early on that good movies are good enough. Both <a href="why-i-love-betty-blue"><em>Betty Blue</em></a> and today’s choice <em>The Jungle Book</em> are never going to win any sort of consensus prize for the best movies ever made but they are really good. They also have a personal history attached that makes them worth writing about.</p>
<p>When I was younger both my sisters would be given VHS copies of Disney movies at a rate of about two a year, one for Christmas and one at their birthday. It seems strange today to think of that pace of movie acquisition, never mind the clunky VHS cassettes and how they would warp over time. I didn’t really ever get any of the Disney movies myself but I would inevitably find myself watching them with my sisters who would watch them repeatedly. With just four TV channels back then, who could blame us.</p></p>

        <p><p>When I was growing up a framed print of a map hung on the wall in the hallway. It was one of my favourite things, littered with strange latin names and with Vs where Us should have been. The outlines of the continents and countries were all familiar and yet slightly distorted, becoming more recognisable around the shores of western Europe.</p>
<p>I don’t know the provenance of that map print but at some point it got taken to the charity shop and replaced by Van Gogh’s sunflowers. I guess that means that I shall never be able to work out exactly what map it was and when it was from.</p></p>

        <p>Jun. 30, 2011</p>
        <p><p>I have had the sort of month that is not conducive to listening to much new music. Therefore this month’s post is only going to consider two new albums and two albums that I have bought behind time. Because of various bits of stress and poor mood, I have ended up going back and taking refuge in some old favourites and not listening to new stuff. At other points I have also gone back to the Fleet Foxes’ album that I wrote about last month, which has grown on me even more since. Sometimes I think that I should writing about these albums on a two month delay. Meanwhile, I even have new music that I haven’t listened to <em>at all</em>, namely <strong>Bon Iver</strong>’s self-titled album. It has received so many good reviews that I have been too intimidated to listen to it. I will try to write about it next month.</p></p>

        <p>Jun. 24, 2011</p>
        <p><p>It was the artwork that got me interested in Tubular Bells II. Rendering Trevor Key&rsquo;s wonderful icon of the twisted tubular bell in yellow and blue made it all the more mysterious. Seeing it one day in Woolworth&rsquo;s in Leigh Park back in 1992 aroused my curiosity. The huge display must have been part of the massive publicity drive for the album. Despite dwindling sales for his albums at that time, a sequel to Tubular Bells represented a huge potential for sales. This is why Oldfield had been lured from his previous home at Virgin records over to Warner Music. At that point Oldfield had not made a good album since his soundtrack to the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087553/"><em>The Killing Fields</em></a> in 1985, the end of a hot streak (perhaps 1980&rsquo;s <em>QE2</em> aside) that had lasted since the original <em>Tubular Bells</em> back in 1973.</p></p>

<p>I was ambivalent on this issue until a few months ago until I came across the following quirky result: if you start with the prime number 41 and then add 2 you get 43, which is also prime and then if you add 4 to 43, you get 47: also prime. <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=evaluate+x%5E2%E2%88%92x%2B41+for+x+from+0..40">And this continues to produce prime numbers if you add successive multiples of two to your running total</a>, UNTIL… you get to the 41st number in this sequence, which is 41 squared.</p></p>
