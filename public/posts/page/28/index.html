        <p>Jul. 31, 2011</p>
        <p><p>Quite a mixed bag this month.</p>
<ol>
<li>SBTRKT <em>SBTRKT</em></li>
<li>Zomby <em>Dedication</em></li>
<li>Brian Eno <em>Drums Between The Bells</em></li>
<li>Bon Iver <em>Bon Iver</em></li>
<li>Washed Out <em>Within and Without</em></li>
</ol>
<p>This month’s collection of albums is a rather mellow bunch. The SBTRKT album (self-titled) is probably the most frenetic of the five though even that does not exactly pound four to the floor. Most of it is pretty calm, though  the occasional burst of pop to spice things up: sometimes it is as downtempo as the rest (<em>Right Thing To Do</em> and <em>Trials Of The Past</em>) but at other times things spark into life, as on <em>Pharaohs</em>.</p></p>

<p>“I read the news today, oh boy”  (The Beatles, <em>A Day In The Life</em>.)</p>

<p>Sometimes watching the news feels like a series of repeated blows to the face: arbitrary, cruel and unrelenting. It gets draining and upsetting, and leaves you fearful of what might come next.</p>
<p>You won’t need me to tell you about the tragedies that have occurred all over the world in the last few days: drought in East Africa, the gunman running amok in Norway, the death of Amy Winehouse and the horrific train crash in China.</p></p>

        <p><h2 id="your-rails-your-fins-your-thin-paper-wings">Your rails, your fins, your thin paper wings</h2>
<p><em>Second Toughest in the Infants</em> (STITI) is the second album by Underworld, released in 1995. This was just ahead of the mania caused by the .NUXX version of Born Slippy appearing on the <em>Trainspotting</em> soundtrack a little later. <em>Born Slippy</em> itself, the blippy techno confection released between their début <em>Dubnobasswithmyheadman</em> and this album. STITI then is very much the calm before the storm and features a band (in the truest sense, which is unusual among electronic acts) in full flow. The sure hands are apparent from the off with the all-in-one trifecta of <em>Juanita</em>, <em>Kiteless</em> and <em>To Dream of Love</em>: a huge slab of a track that propels, mashes and then glides over various tempos in its sixteen minute run.</p></p>

        <p>Jul. 19, 2011</p>
        <p><p>Reading a few articles about the recent launch of Google+, a few things hit home. Google tends to launch a product that works and not always one that is perfect or finished (like, say, Apple). Sometimes it takes them several iterations to get right. They love the beta tag. In fact, I think it was Google (or possibly Flickr) that made me aware of the concept of beta software.</p>
<p>Along these line I thought about this blog and its one year anniversary. I take a similar approach here to posts on this blog, specifically in pushing out new categories now and then. I have done this in the hope that adding a new subject or thread will lead to me writing more posts. Currently I am averaging ten posts a month, which is not too bad.</p></p>

        <p>Jul. 12, 2011</p>
        <p><p>Just as with the <a href="understated-classics">understated classics</a> I want to set out my stall early on that good movies are good enough. Both <a href="why-i-love-betty-blue"><em>Betty Blue</em></a> and today’s choice <em>The Jungle Book</em> are never going to win any sort of consensus prize for the best movies ever made but they are really good. They also have a personal history attached that makes them worth writing about.</p>
<p>When I was younger both my sisters would be given VHS copies of Disney movies at a rate of about two a year, one for Christmas and one at their birthday. It seems strange today to think of that pace of movie acquisition, never mind the clunky VHS cassettes and how they would warp over time. I didn’t really ever get any of the Disney movies myself but I would inevitably find myself watching them with my sisters who would watch them repeatedly. With just four TV channels back then, who could blame us.</p></p>

        <p>Jul. 2, 2011</p>
        <p><p>When I was growing up a framed print of a map hung on the wall in the hallway. It was one of my favourite things, littered with strange latin names and with Vs where Us should have been. The outlines of the continents and countries were all familiar and yet slightly distorted, becoming more recognisable around the shores of western Europe.</p>
<p>I don’t know the provenance of that map print but at some point it got taken to the charity shop and replaced by Van Gogh’s sunflowers. I guess that means that I shall never be able to work out exactly what map it was and when it was from.</p></p>

        <p>Jun. 30, 2011</p>
        <p><p>I have had the sort of month that is not conducive to listening to much new music. Therefore this month’s post is only going to consider two new albums and two albums that I have bought behind time. Because of various bits of stress and poor mood, I have ended up going back and taking refuge in some old favourites and not listening to new stuff. At other points I have also gone back to the Fleet Foxes’ album that I wrote about last month, which has grown on me even more since. Sometimes I think that I should writing about these albums on a two month delay. Meanwhile, I even have new music that I haven’t listened to <em>at all</em>, namely <strong>Bon Iver</strong>’s self-titled album. It has received so many good reviews that I have been too intimidated to listen to it. I will try to write about it next month.</p></p>

        <p>Jun. 24, 2011</p>
        <p><p>It was the artwork that got me interested in Tubular Bells II. Rendering Trevor Key&rsquo;s wonderful icon of the twisted tubular bell in yellow and blue made it all the more mysterious. Seeing it one day in Woolworth&rsquo;s in Leigh Park back in 1992 aroused my curiosity. The huge display must have been part of the massive publicity drive for the album. Despite dwindling sales for his albums at that time, a sequel to Tubular Bells represented a huge potential for sales. This is why Oldfield had been lured from his previous home at Virgin records over to Warner Music. At that point Oldfield had not made a good album since his soundtrack to the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087553/"><em>The Killing Fields</em></a> in 1985, the end of a hot streak (perhaps 1980&rsquo;s <em>QE2</em> aside) that had lasted since the original <em>Tubular Bells</em> back in 1973.</p></p>

        <p><p>What’s your favourite number?</p>
<p>I was ambivalent on this issue until a few months ago until I came across the following quirky result: if you start with the prime number 41 and then add 2 you get 43, which is also prime and then if you add 4 to 43, you get 47: also prime. <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=evaluate+x%5E2%E2%88%92x%2B41+for+x+from+0..40">And this continues to produce prime numbers if you add successive multiples of two to your running total</a>, UNTIL… you get to the 41st number in this sequence, which is 41 squared.</p></p>

<p>You are tracked pretty much everywhere you go. CCTV, the GPS on your phone or the signals sent by your more primitive model to the masts to keep in touch with the network. Your cash withdrawals, your purchases in Tesco and your journeys on public transport all add to the picture of where you are. If you drive, your sat nav will hold clues to where you have been and, if you disappear, where you might have gone to.</p></p>

<li>Kate Bush <em>Director’s Cut</em></li>
<li>Africa Hitech <em>93 Million Miles</em></li>
<li>Fleet Foxes <em>Helplessness Blues</em></li>
<li>TV On The Radio <em>Nine Types of Light</em></li>
</ol>
<p>There is a pleasing red hue to all the covers this month. I had time to write four full reviews of the major albums I listened to. Like last month I have included a video at the foot of each review. Enjoy!</p>
<h2 id="kate-bush-_directors-cut_">Kate Bush <em>Director’s Cut</em></h2>
<p><em>Director’s Cut</em> is not a new album from Kate Bush but a collection of re-visits to old songs, four from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sensual_World"><em>The Sensual World</em></a> (1989) and seven from [<em>The Red Shoes</em>](<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Shoes_(album)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Shoes_(album)</a> (1993). It is certainly an interesting idea to re-examine old songs with hindsight, something usually only done with live albums or dodgy remixes. It is rare to have an artist to even admit flaws in their earlier material, let alone for them to go back and attempt to fix them.</p></p>

        <p>May. 6, 2011</p>
        <p><h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p><em>Tiger Bay</em> is Saint Etienne&rsquo;s third album and I think it is among their best. It was released in June 1994 on Heavenly records. I first owned a copy in 1998 when I picked it up while living in halls as an undergraduate. The reason for including this album in the understated classics series is the same as for <a href="uc8"><em>Second Light</em></a> by Dreadzone: it marries traditional forms to newer electronic music<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. <em>Second Light</em> melds classical music and sea shanties to house and dub reggae to evoke the rolling hills and mystic caves of England. <em>Tiger Bay</em> grafts folk structures on to Balearic pop songs and electronic experiments in order to visit motorway verges, windswept seashores, and Mediterranean holidays. There is even a ghost story (<em>Boy Scouts of America</em>) for good measure.</p></p>
