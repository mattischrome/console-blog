Anches en Maat, their first album in six years or so, and the first with the entire band in the studio together since 2008, is their most Grails-y album in a long time.</p></div>

    <div><p>As you get older nostalgia becomes an ever important part of listening to music. It often feels like the business relies on convincing an aging population of fans to part with their money on new versions of old material. It&rsquo;s nostalgia, the feeling of recapturing something you loved in your youth, that often makes this acceptable. Of course it&rsquo;s also nice to get <strong>new</strong> music from your favourite bands, especially when it&rsquo;s as good as &ldquo;Fuse&rdquo;.</p></div>

    <div><p>Radical Romantics, the third album by Fever Ray was released in April. I bought a copy on red vinyl which is a beautiful sight to behold. I listened to a lot when it was released but eased up a bit until listening to it a couple more times while writing this list. It&rsquo;s a great collection of songs, probably better than their second album &ldquo;Plunge&rdquo;. The cover art is just as scary though.</p></div>

    <div><p>Agartha is the debut album by Japanese electronic artist Wata Igarashi. I don&rsquo;t really know much about him, but I do know that I enjoy releases on the German record label Kompakt and I have really enjoyed Japanese techno in recent years. Over lockdown I discovered Haruomi Hosono&rsquo;s &ldquo;Polyharmony&rdquo; album and re-discovered the work of Shinichi Atobe, particularly their album &ldquo;Love of Plastic&rdquo;. Both of those albums could be future understated classics and while both are by Japanese artists working in electronic music, there the comparison ends.</p></div>

    <div><p>Another year (nearly) over and so starting from tomorrow, I&rsquo;m going to count down my top 10 albums of 2023. The rules are:</p>
<ol>
<li>They have to have to have been released in 2023.</li>
<li>They need to be albums. I&rsquo;m defining this as either more than 7 tracks or songs, or more than forty minutes in length.</li>
<li>To make the top ten, they need to have been played the most times. I admit that I don&rsquo;t have a precise measure of this, as I do still buy vinyl and about four of these albums will have had play counts missed by not being captured through a streaming service.</li>
<li>Compilations are not included, whether they feature multiple artists or a retrospective of a single artist.</li>
</ol>
<p>And that&rsquo;s pretty much it. Have I done any prep work? Well no, not really. I made a preliminary list at the start of October and not only was the number one album not out at the time (!) but I also had mistakenly included two albums from 2022. So yeah, this is not a pro operation. 😂</p></div>

Among these the number of Chinese leaders has increased from two to five. Therefore it&rsquo;s probably a good time to start writing about one of them, and where better to start than the OG himself, Qin Shi Huang. The recent leader pass has created a new persona for him but today we shall focus on his original version, which is now referred to in-game as his &ldquo;Mandate of Heaven&rdquo; persona.</p></div>

I looked in my music library and there it was! As a result this is not so much an <a href="/tag/album%20revisit/">album revisit</a> as an album _<em>visit</em>.</p>
<p>Anyway, this album was released in 2010 and did quite well. In fact, &ldquo;Bright Lights&rdquo; is a reissue of an album that was originally released as &ldquo;Lights&rdquo; (February 2010). This version adds seven extra tracks, which explains why it&rsquo;s an exhausting seventeen tracks long. &ldquo;Lights&rdquo; was a successful debut and a few of the singles went top 20, which is what led to its re-release with all those extra songs in November of the same year. (I think this is why it is in my collection, I think I bought it for my mum or for a sibling as part of a Christmas present, and ripped the CD out of curiosity&hellip;)</p></div>

    <div><p>I&rsquo;m a massive fan of hot chocolate. Recently a friend recommended M&amp;S hot chocolate flakes. Thanks to a promotion it was about half the price of the Montezuma&rsquo;s hot chocolate discs that we usually buy. The Montezuma&rsquo;s ones are lush (that&rsquo;s official hot chocolate tasting terminology) but in this economy anything that saves a bit of money has got to be good right?</p>
<p>However, there are other things to consider. For one, what&rsquo;s the cost per drink? After reading the instructions for the M&amp;S hot chocolate, it was clear that it might not make as many drinks as the Montezuma&rsquo;s hot chocolate does.  That said, we prefer to use one disc rather than the suggested two,  and sure enough, we also found that we only needed about half the hot chocolate when using the M&amp;S flakes too. Nevertheless you still get 66% more drinks from the Montezuma&rsquo;s hot chocolate.</p></div>

    <div><p>This is one of my more played Fabric mix CDs so I decided to go for it when my random prompter plumped for this earlier today. One constraint of these posts was to write it in roughly the amount of time it takes to listen to it. You&rsquo;d think that for a mix CD that would be ok. After all, this mix is a full CD and 74 minutes long.</p></div>

    <div><p>I&rsquo;ve managed to extract my music library, including all the albums I&rsquo;ve added to streaming, as a CSV file and write a routine in R to select an album at random. The plan is to write about that album for the blog in roughly the time that it takes to listen to that album all the way through. I already did this yesterday for <a href="/goldfrapp-black-cherry">Goldfrapp&rsquo;s Black Cherry.</a></p>
<p>But I have to level with you. That was not the first album that was picked. Nor is the album selection process entirely unbiased. I got to a working situation and stopped there. Essentially, I smoosh together artist and album title, so that albums like compilations, or albums where the lead artist collaborates with multiple other artists, are slightly over-represented. I say slightly as the pool was already pretty large with just unique albums. I might do what I did yesterday and ignore singles or compilations, especially as the code takes almost zero time to give me another idea.</p></div>
