        <p>Sep. 30, 2016</p>
        <p><p>This month&rsquo;s album digest features albums by Wilco, M.I.A., Local Natives, and a collaboration between Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith and Suzanne Ciani.</p>
<h3 id="wilco-schmilco">Wilco <em>Schmilco</em></h3>
<p><em>Schmilco</em> is the tenth studio album by Wilco, which regular readers will know are one of my favourite bands. <a href="/whatever-happened-to-that-hat/">There&rsquo;s no need to repeat that anecdote about why this blog has the name that it does.</a> Meanwhile, this album follows on from last year&rsquo;s <em>Star Wars</em> and is probably the third Wilco album to have a jokey meta- kind of title. (The other one is the rather splendid <em>Wilco (The Album)</em> from 2009.) I didn&rsquo;t write a review of <em>Star Wars</em>; it  was released for free and for some reason it passed me by. <em>Schmilco</em> is a fairly similar album and that&rsquo;s not a bad thing.</p></p>

        <p>Sep. 24, 2016</p>
        <p><p>A few weeks ago, Ingrid and I went to see The Threepenny Opera at the National Theatre.</p>
<p>The Threepenny Opera was written by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill, based on Elisabeth Hauptmann&rsquo;s German translation of John Gay&rsquo;s &ldquo;A Beggar&rsquo;s Opera&rdquo;. It was first performed in Weimar Berlin in 1928 and has evolved over time through many adaptations, including several film and off-Broadway versions. It&rsquo;s a work with very powerful musical overtones and, despite avowals otherwise throughout by the narrator, it has a powerful moral message.</p></p>

        <p><p>Witness the pressure of a new notebook. You sit at your desk, trying to get it started with an amazing piece of writing. Something worthy of that crisp new page. You want it to tumble out of you, fully formed and coherent. Something that justifies you abandoning the previous one. As though first drafts don&rsquo;t exist. You cast yourself into the role of shaman, of seer - of someone gifted a prophetic vision. But it&rsquo;s a role that you cannot and will not fulfil.</p></p>

        <p>Aug. 31, 2016</p>
        <p><p>As I mentioned in yesterday&rsquo;s post, I allowed Spotify to pick some new albums for me this month. It chose some noodly ambient techno, a captivating slice of World Jazz, a moody gothic hallucination, and a concept album about humans being rescued by aliens. All in all a pretty good job! Here is the list:</p>
<ol>
<li>Prins Thomas &ldquo;Principe del Norte&rdquo;</li>
<li>Sarathy Korwar &ldquo;Day to Day&rdquo;</li>
<li>Doomsquad &ldquo;Total Time&rdquo;</li>
<li>United Vibrations &ldquo;The Myth of the Golden Ratio&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="prins-thomas-principe-del-norte">Prins Thomas &ldquo;Principe del Norte&rdquo;</h2>
<p><a href="/orb-alpine-diskomiks-sin-in-space-pt-2/">Prins Thomas recently remixed the Orb&rsquo;s &ldquo;Alpine EP&rdquo;</a> so I&rsquo;m not surprised that Spotify included one of his tracks on my Discover Weekly playlist. The connection was obviously waiting to be made. &ldquo;Principe del Norte&rdquo; was released back in March and features 9 tracks over almost 90 minutes. Each track title is a single letter, save the first two which are labelled A1 and A2. I think it was B that caught my attention, a proper old school ambient tune but one with some teeth.</p></p>

        <p>Aug. 30, 2016</p>
        <p><p>Because I couldn&rsquo;t find any albums coming out this month that I wanted to review for the album digest, I decided to let Spotify pick the albums to listen to. I listened to my algorithmically chosen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/20/why-browse-when-you-can-play/">Discover Weekly</a> playlist one week and selected albums based on the songs that I liked the most. The album also had to be released in 2016. The selections are ones that got away.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done this before. <a href="/album-digest-august-2012/">Three of the four albums that I wrote about in August four years ago</a> were selected by <a href="https://bleep.com">Bleep</a>: they were in the &lsquo;best albums of the year so far&rsquo; bundle that I bought. So this month&rsquo;s album digest is bought to you by the same idea, just a different curator.</p></p>

        <p><p>We went to see <a href="http://www.ulsterorchestra.org.uk/events/2016-08-21/">Prom 47</a>, an afternoon prom at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The bill included a brand new work by <a href="http://piershellawell.com">Piers Hellawell</a>, along with a Cello concerto by <a href="http://classicalmusic.about.com/od/classicalcomposers/p/haydnprofile.htm">Haydn</a> and a symphony by <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pyotr-Ilyich-Tchaikovsky">Tchaikovsky</a>. These were all performed by the <a href="http://www.ulsterorchestra.org.uk">Ulster Orchestra</a>. The conductor was Rafael Payare. The tickets were an affordable £17 each which isn&rsquo;t bad at all given that we were sat in the second row of the circle. We had a great view.</p></p>

        <p>Jul. 31, 2016</p>
        <p><p>Album Digest July 2016 consists of a bumper five albums, mainly because I couldn&rsquo;t work out which one to drop. I think they&rsquo;re all pretty good though it&rsquo;s great to hear new music from The Avalanches after all this time.</p>
<h2 id="bat-for-lashes-the-bride">Bat For Lashes &ldquo;The Bride&rdquo;</h2>
<p>For her fourth album as Bat For Lashes, Natasha Khan applies her considerable songwriting skills to a concept album. She sings from the perspective of a bride whose husband dies on his way to their wedding. Almost all artists would deliver this subject matter in a melodramatic way, but Khan focusses on the sadness and delivers a beautiful suite of songs.</p></p>

        <p>Jul. 30, 2016</p>
        <p><p><a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/acts-of-the-assassins/richard-beard/9780099592938">Acts of the Assassins</a> is an interesting novel by <a href="http://www.richardbeard.info">Richard Beard</a> that retells the story of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostle_(Christian)">the apostles</a> and their deaths. It uses a modern crime genre style and a contemporary setting. The author himself refers to it as &ldquo;Gospel Noir&rdquo;.
Cassius Gallio, a Roman CSI-type referred to as a speculator, investigates the murders of the apostles following the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus. Gallio, charged with guarding the body following Jesus&rsquo; death and greatly undermined by the disappearance of the body, views the resurrection as the greatest conspiracy of the age.</p></p>

        <p>Jul. 20, 2016</p>
        <p><p>I give the impression of planning these posts but to be honest I came across an article about Maxwell a few weeks ago and fondly remembered my cassette copy of this album. The joy of Spotify is that it&rsquo;s easy to dig up old favourites. The recent warm weather makes for a good opportunity to enjoy the sultry embrace of &ldquo;Embrya&rdquo; once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gestation: Mythos&rdquo; burbles along for two and a half minutes, overlaying spoken word samples, string phrases and weird underwater noises, before the bass line of &ldquo;Everwanting: To Want You To Want&rdquo; brings things to life. Over a sinuous and aquatic background, Maxwell delivers a smooth and soulful vocal. As you might guess from the title, it&rsquo;s definitely one for your late nights and warm evenings playlist. I love the way that the song takes its time: it knows where it needs to go, it knows how to get there, and damned if it isn&rsquo;t going to enjoy itself on the way.</p></p>

<p>We left Uyuni the night after the big storm, having stopped just a day or so to visit the salt flats. Our next stop was a strategic stay in Tupiza, a large town encircled with red hills. It resembled many towns that I visited in South America: low buildings arranged in a grid pattern. Not much greenery and plenty of dust billowing about. The reason for our stay was strategic, it&rsquo;s only a short distance to the notoriously fussy border between Bolivia and Argentina. We would leave at 5am the next morning so we would reach the border early in case of a long delay, which can happen at this border.</p></p>

        <p><p><a href="/high-rise/">I last wrote about a JG Ballard novel nearly three years ago</a>. That one - &ldquo;High-Rise&rdquo; - <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/20/high-rise-review-ben-wheatley-jg-ballard-tom-hiddleston">has since been made into a film</a>. The subject of this post is &ldquo;The Unlimited Dream Company&rdquo;, my favourite among his novels: a silly romp through suburban sexual repression that glitters with sinister wit. Even after many read-throughs I still can&rsquo;t work out whether it is a crazy masterpiece or something light that we&rsquo;re meant to throw away after reading.</p></p>
