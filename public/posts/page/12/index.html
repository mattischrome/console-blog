        <p>Sep. 28, 2017</p>
        <p><p>We bought a cheap package holiday in the British Airways Black Friday sale. The weekend spanned Ingrid&rsquo;s birthday, so it was ideal. £99 each for flights and a hotel, and we bagged a hire car quite cheaply too.</p>
<p>Because our flight was from Heathrow and the trains from Chichester are both expensive and inconvenient for early flights, we spoiled ourselves with a taxi to the airport. It felt very strange to be whisked through the Sussex and Surrey countryside at six am on a Friday morning!</p></p>

        <p><p>I came late to Orbital&rsquo;s work. I knew of them through a few remixes and because as a mad Orb fan, they could not have avoided my notice could they? Apart from that, one of my college friends tried to get me into &ldquo;In Sides&rdquo; just after its release in 1996. The same friend got me into <a href="/understated-classics-11/">&ldquo;Second Toughest In The Infants&rdquo; by Underworld</a>. I cannot now understand the reason, but &ldquo;In Sides&rdquo; just left me cold.</p></p>

        <p>Jul. 17, 2017</p>
        <p><p>In my last post, I wrote about hills. I tried to use them as a metaphor to explain nagging sense of incompletion when you single out one activity over another. The feeling that there&rsquo;s always a more exciting hill off in the distance to go climb, instead of the one you&rsquo;re on.</p>
<p>I said my next post would be about how to pick between different options, particularly when you have many to choose from. This post is not that. This is a short piece about an experience I had in South America that relates to the hills post: about contentment in the moment and letting things go.</p></p>

        <p><p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of books. The way they transport you away to other places and so on. As repositories of knowledge and adventure they can&rsquo;t be beat. I can think of no better way out of an existential fix than reading.</p>
<p>The trouble is I tend to hoard them. I&rsquo;ve posted pictures of <a href="https://mattischrome.com/reading-list-mid-april-2012/">book stacks before</a> (<a href="https://mattischrome.com/another-reading-list/">on more than one occasion</a>). I could probably repeat that every month if I wanted to, perhaps even more often. I&rsquo;ve always been a networked thinker, able to see (at least superficially) the connections between all sorts of things. Because of this I get excited and enthusiastic about all kinds of things, and I want to learn them all.</p></p>

        <p>Jul. 1, 2017</p>
        <p><p>I enjoyed Wonder Woman, which came as a surprise to me given my growing distaste for superhero movies. <a href="man-of-steel-a-short-review">I can remember seeing the Superman reboot Man of Steel</a> with its phallic rockets and its boring boring fight sequences. But almost everything about Wonder Woman exceeded my expectations. It&rsquo;s a well-made superhero movie and better still, it gets to the heart of why these kinds of movies matter.</p>
<p>Whereas Man of Steel ended up levelling cities and criminally underusing Amy Adams, all while giving us no stake on why Superman even matters as a man or a hero, Wonder Woman focusses tightly on its main character and explains what matters to her, and in turn the movie then explains why she should matter to us. In other words, it&rsquo;s not boring and it&rsquo;s not pointless.</p></p>

        <p>Jun. 16, 2017</p>
        <p><p>It can be a struggle to keep writing. I&rsquo;ve found this happened a lot since I moved the blog. First, there was  the business of moving things over. That meant a lot of thought about old posts and which ones I should keep. A lot of the time I thought &ldquo;how on earth did I have time to write this?!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then there seemed to be a lot more barriers to writing than previously. We can say what we like about the machinery that WordPress runs on, it does make it easy to write regularly. It also provides a lot of tools for making writing fun and for learning things as you go. I still have access to those things but it&rsquo;s a little different now.</p></p>

<p>Et voila, my blog lives! In a new body (<a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>) and at <a href="%7B%7Babsolute.url%7D%7D">a new location</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-process">The Process</h2>
<p>I set up Jekyll on my MacBook Air after loads of initial problems with installing the theme and getting assorted Ruby gems installed and working. <a href="https://www.stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a> is a friend for life now. By way of comparison, getting things up and running on my new Mac was simple.</p></p>

        <p><h2 id="blanck-mass-world-eater">Blanck Mass <em>World Eater</em></h2>
<p>This album is pretty extreme. It&rsquo;s not for everyone and even for the people who <em>can</em> handle it, it&rsquo;s not for all the time. This album is a soul crushing experience at points but there are also points of light. Perhaps this makes “World Eater” more reflective of life as a whole than any other of this month&rsquo;s albums. On balance it&rsquo;s probably less crushing than the last Blanck Mass album “Dumb Flesh”, which I reviewed back in June 2015.</p></p>

<p>Some albums are good because a band continues making the music that you love. Some albums are good because a band takes their ideas a step or two further than before. <em>Chalice Hymnal</em>is that rare album that does both of these things.</p>
<p>The references to past albums include the track <em>Deeper Politics</em> and <em>Deep Snow II</em>, and, as per albums past, these tracks evolve slowly out of languid guitar hooks and smoky atmospherics. If it ain&rsquo;t broke don&rsquo;t fix it.</p></p>

        <p><h2 id="mike-oldfield-return-to-ommadawn">Mike Oldfield <em>Return to Ommadawn</em></h2>
<p>With <em>Return to Ommadawn</em>, Mike Oldfield revisits his third album Ommadawn. He has past form for this, having revisited his masterwork Tubular Bells twice (the third revisit and fourth instalment Tubular Bells 4 is due next year). I wrote about Tubular Bells II for my understated classics series. Of course Mike has in fact made many more than three Tubular Bells albums<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, and this is not a first &ldquo;return&rdquo; to Ommadawn. His 1990 album Amorok was a similar affair.</p></p>

        <p>Oct. 13, 2016</p>
        <p><p>The next instalment in my understated classics series is &quot;Stray&quot; by <a href="http://killermontstreet.net">Aztec Camera</a>. Released in 1990, it features two hit singles and the cover is my favourite colour: green.</p>
<p>My angle for writing about “Stray” was that it was an album that I &quot;caught&quot; from my parents. I soon realised that I wrote about some of those already, for example “The Circle and the Square&quot; by Red Box. Besides, I’m not sure that my parents liked this album that much.</p></p>

        <p>Oct. 10, 2016</p>
        <p><p><a href="https://gimletmedia.com/show/heavyweight/about/">Heavyweight</a> is a podcast about “heavyweight” issues, in the sense of burdens on the soul, rather than the burning issues of the day. It’s presented by Jonathan Goldstein, who was the host of the WireTap podcast. Each week he helps someone resolve an issue from their past. These include resolving family feuds and understanding mid-life depression.</p>
<p>I am a generalist who often takes a broader view of things. Heavyweight reminds me that the emotions of individuals are as important as the wider trends that affect groups. It’s helped reinforce my recent thinking that one leads to the other and that it’s more of a causal relationship than we might think. Despite my interest in the general, I’m a microeconomist at heart.</p></p>
