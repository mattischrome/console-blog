    <div><p>These are some things I jotted down one day last week, I&rsquo;ll refine them a bit more later on. Think of it as an aide-memoire of things that work for me, your milage may vary.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t worry about things that haven&rsquo;t happened.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t turn whatever has happened and/or is bothering you into a catastrophe, especially if no one else is telling you that it is one. Seek out someone you trust and ask them &ldquo;is this a catastrophe?&rdquo; Not only will they say no about 99.9% of the time, they will often tell you why it isn&rsquo;t a catastrophe.</li>
<li>The people who are important to you will not use your personal characteristics as a laundry list of personal failings in the same way that you do. In fact they won&rsquo;t do it all. What you perceive as your own obvious and innate failings, others will often struggle to even see. Self awareness and hyper-awareness are two different things.</li>
<li>There will be people who don&rsquo;t like you, people who don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re good enough, and people who won&rsquo;t give you a chance. They most likely intersect, meaning there are fewer of them than you might think. You don&rsquo;t have to satisfy these people, only those who like you and support you. Most of all, you have to be good enough for you.</li>
<li>Everybody has different needs and wants in life. Even though your needs and wants will often intersect with those of others, there is still no reason to use other people as the measure for what you should be getting out of life.</li>
<li>A person has more depth and dimensions than are measurable. If you focus solely on a single metric when you measure yourself against some standard or goal, you will be wrong in some way or another. A qualified and multi-dimensional validation of your progress will give you a more nuanced and more supportive sense of where you are heading and how to correct yourself.</li>
<li>Always focus on your capability. Regard potential as something to be shaped into capability.</li>
<li>Take time to think about things in many different ways, employing both proven mental models and lateral thinking.</li>
<li>Often problems are easier to tackle once you have been for a walk in the countryside.</li>

Starting out as Sub Sub, they scored a worldwide hit in 1993 with &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t No Love (Ain&rsquo;t No Use)&rdquo;: a timeless dance tune that immediately owns whatever room it plays in. However, subsequent releases by Sub Sub did not catch on and people started to think of the band as a one-hit wonder.</p></div>

I bought more albums on vinyl and only a small proportion of those were recently released music. Meanwhile, the attractions of Spotify&rsquo;s release radar proved too great to resist: it is a very convenient way to consume new music.</p></div>

    <div><p>Ingrid and I love playing Civ VI. It&rsquo;s a fine game that improves on previous versions, adding many layers and mechanics that mean you can vary your playing style. In fact, with the recent Gathering Storm expansion there&rsquo;s now an incredible variety of ways to play. The 39 leaders to play with both reflect and provide the game&rsquo;s increased complexity. Each leader has a slightly different mechanic that influences how you play the game, and of course the leaders you are up against also affect your game play. You can pick leaders to go up against that will make your game easier or harder. Some leaders can even be an existential threat if you spawn near to them and, as I&rsquo;ve learned the hard way, it&rsquo;s not always the leaders you expect that cause these problems.</p></div>

<p>I found &ldquo;The Overstory&rdquo; an enjoyable read. Its accessibility surprised me. Often people view Booker nominated novels as stuffy or over-intellectual. This novel however is a genuine page turner, full of emotion and heartbreak, not to mention plenty of science and awe of the natural world. Perhaps in another year it may have won.</p></div>

    <div><p>For our <a href="the-same-but-different">first anniversary</a> we decided to exhange books. What better way to <a href="https://ideas.hallmark.com/articles/anniversary-ideas/anniversary-gifts-by-year/">celebrate a paper anniversary</a>? Ingrid bought me the entire Foundation saga, most of which were <a href="https://abcoverd.co.uk/archive/designers/topping-mike">reissued in fancy new paperback designs by Mike Topping</a> in 2016. All save for 1993&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/7lueju/asimovs_forward_the_foundation_published_in_2016/">Forward The Foundation</a> that is, but Ingrid got me a copy anyway. Hence, here is a new series of blog posts!</p>
<p>The Foundation novels detail a galactic empire in decline. A mathematician named Hari Seldon, using a novel science called psychohistory, realises that this is happening and formulates a plan for humanity, one that will reduce the time between empires. This, he reasons, will minimise human suffering and prevent an extended period of barbarism.</p></div>
