        <p>Mar. 18, 2013</p>
        <p><p>A while back, I decided I was going to write about the Iain M. Banks sci-fi-novels (mainly as a respite from having to read and write about <a href="j-g-ballard">J. G. Ballard novels</a>, but I only got as fas as writing about the excellent “Against A Dark Barkground” and re-reading the first of the Culture novels “Consider Phlebas”. WARNING: Some plot spoilers follow (but not too many).</p>
<p>I’m not sure why it has taken almost two years to write about this novel. Perhaps it is because I couldn’t find myself a proper explanation for the title. The following is my own theory, feel free to add your own in the comments. The book takes its name from the epigraph, an extract from T.S. Elliot’s <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/201/1.html">“The Waste Land”</a> (which is also on my “to read” list):</p></p>

        <p>Mar. 13, 2013</p>
        <p><p>“Walking With Thee” is the second album by Liverpool band <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic_(band)">Clinic</a>. It was released in 2002, which seems like an age ago now. Even longer ago they released the single “The Return of Evil Bill”, which was got me interested in them in the first place.</p>
<p>I recently got back into “Walking With Thee” when I picked “Vulture” in my A-Z of Animals playlist last month. I’d forgotten just how great a song it is, both musically and lyrically. It’s a caution against letting those with more power and wealth lord it over us – viz, “the best that you’ve left here for others / is the best the rest of us know” – and so it’s surely much more a song for these times than back then in 2002. Anyway, I’m going to avoid too much reading into the lyrics for this particular understated classic, as most of the time Clinic are defiantly resistant to that kind of analysis.</p></p>

        <p>Mar. 5, 2013</p>
        <p><p>I have had a lot of ideas for posts swirling around in my head in recent days. This is because I have actually done quite a lot of cool things in that time, and because I have hung out with some great people who make me think, and because I always have a whole load of things bouncing around in there anyway - space junk of the mind. I was thinking about how to put together these thoughts I have been having about art and about stories and yes, about love too. It all kind of got muddled up and then I saw it.</p></p>

        <h1><a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/album-digest-february-2013/" title="Album Digest, February 2013">Album Digest, February 2013</a></h1>
        <p>Feb. 28, 2013</p>
        <p><p>Most Februaries are quite quiet when it comes to albums (though this was not the case <a href="album-digest-february-2011">back in 2011</a>) and although only the Foals album is a major release, I was quite surprised to find myself with four decent albums to write about. They are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Darkstar &ldquo;News From Nowhere&rdquo;</li>
<li>Foals &ldquo;Holy Fire&rdquo;</li>
<li>Daniel Hope &ldquo;Spheres&rdquo;</li>
<li>Apparat &ldquo;Krieg und Frieden (Music For Theatre)&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="darkstar-news-from-nowhere">Darkstar &ldquo;News From Nowhere&rdquo;</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to give too much biographical background for the Darkstar album as I don&rsquo;t know too much about who the are. I saw this album and its lovely artwork in an e-mail from <a href="http://www.bleep.com/">bleep.com</a>. Because it was on Spotify, I gave it a go. At first I wasn&rsquo;t too impressed but over repeated listens, it has become my favourite album of the month.</p></p>

        <p>Feb. 26, 2013</p>
        <p><p>The existence, or impending existence, of a new novel by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Pynchon">Thomas Pynchon</a> was <a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/02/25/pynchon-takes-on-silicon-alley/">announced today</a>. I have all his previous books (seven written over a period of about fifty years, a pace that I definitely approve of), though he’s a hard author to get close to: I’ve only finished three and started four up till now. The unfinished one is, of course, Gravity’s Rainbow (GR) and somewhat perversely, I have two copies of the thing. Of the three unstarted, both Mason &amp; Dixon (MD) and Against The Day (ATD) seem too dense and intimidating, while Vineland just begs me to read The Crying Of Lot 49 (L49) or Inherent Vice (IV) one more time.</p></p>

        <p>Feb. 11, 2013</p>
        <p><p>The other weekend, beset by insomnia, I decided to follow <a href="five-things-to-try-when-you-cant-sleep">my own advice</a> and get up to do something instead of wallowing unable to sleep. I pulled my emergency jigsaw out of the cupboard and set to it. I should stress that I mean a jigsaw puzzle and not an actually jigsaw: DIY at 2am is not such a good idea!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d forgotten how interesting jigsaw puzzles actually are. As I sat there contemplating the 1000 pieces and wondered exactly what I&rsquo;d let myself in for, I found myself thinking about a number of things.</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 31, 2013</p>
        <p><p>Only one of this month three albums was actually released this month. Nelly Furtado&rsquo;s Mi plan was actually released over three years ago - I only discovered it last year when I wrote <a href="album-digest-september-2012">the September album digest</a> following the release of &ldquo;The Spirit Indestructible&rdquo;, or it might have been when I wrote about <a href="uc20">&ldquo;Folklore&rdquo;</a> at around the same time.</p>
<p>Anyway, I guess these are albums that I bought with my Christmas gift vouchers!</p></p>

        <p>Dec. 31, 2012</p>
        <p><p>Three albums (one very Christmassey one!) and an EP this month.</p>
<ol>
<li>Tracey Thorn “Tinsel and Lights”</li>
<li>Woob “Have Landed”</li>
<li>Tim Hecker and Daniel Lopatin “Instrumental Tourist”</li>
<li>Burial “Truant / Rough Sleeper</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="tracey-thorn-tinsel-and-lights">Tracey Thorn “Tinsel and Lights”</h2>
<p>“Tinsel and Lights” is that rarest of records, a Christmas record that is perfectly suited to the season and is not in any way overbearing or irritating. Most albums that are Christmas themed are usually centred on lots of covers that are taken from a small subset of well worn classics. The songs on “Tinsel And Lights” are either originals or slightly more obscure covers and this works to its great advantage. The most famous song here (“Have yourself a merry little Christmas” aside) is probably the White Stripes’ “In The Cold Cold Night” and that’s not really a Christmas song (though it works better here than I’d anticipated).</p></p>

<p>When it comes to Bat For Lashes, I prefer her first album “Fur And Gold” to her second “Two Suns” because when I listen to the latter I don’t feel connected to any of the songs. For me, “Fur And Gold” remains a wonderful adventure throughout, it’s a fantastic listen.</p></p>

        <p><p>A cat reaches the top of a mountain after a long climb through the snow. He is cold from the bottom of his fur to the tips of his claws. He is sodden and wet, and we all know how much a cat hates to be wet.</p>
<p>At the top of the mountain there is not much to see. What may have been a breathtaking view is instead a murk of freezing mist and at any rate, snow assails the cat’s eyes and whiskers. He shivers and sneezes.</p></p>

        <p>Nov. 21, 2012</p>
        <p><p>The second Woob album (AKA “Woob 4495”) is probably the greatest ambient album ever made and is certainly the best one you have never heard of. Originally released in 1995 <a href="http://www.emit.cc">on the em:t label</a> it is also a rare record. I don’t have an actual copy but I have seen one! I downloaded it off the internet and even that is quite difficult to do. My friend is an avid collector of all the em:t releases and it is easy to see why: all the albums are titled in a specific way that is very appealing to people who like to collect things and they also have very striking nature photography on the covers. In a strange way, the label was able to create an identity for its releases in a way that many artists would try to.</p></p>
