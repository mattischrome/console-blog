    <div><p>This month was strange. I didn’t listen to much new music and after <a href="/album-digest-april-2014/">last month’s bumper digest</a> there’s probably a reason for that. Not to mention that Spotify gives you more reasons to look backwards than forwards. Nevertheless, this brief post features new albums by Little Dragon and Coldplay, along with the mini-album collaboration between Röyskopp and Robyn.</p>
<h2 id="little-dragon-nabuma-rubberband">Little Dragon “Nabuma Rubberband”</h2>
<p>I discovered Little Dragon, like most people, I imagine, via Gorillaz’ “Plastic Beach” album. When I investigated their “Machine Dreams” album I was surprised that their sound had transplanted to “Plastic Beach” intact. Sometimes you discover a band through a collaboration and their own work turns out to be disappointing, somehow diminished by the other artist(s) no longer being present. “Machine Dreams” is a fine album that breezes by, much like “Empire Ants” and “To Binge” do on “Plastic Beach”.</p></div>

It came along in beta in just 2008 just as I needed it to manage my PhD thesis. In fact I often jokingly claim to having invented it by asking on the MacRumors forums whether a program like it existed  - just a few weeks before its beta rode in to my life like a knight in shining armour. I recognised the need for a service that would synchronise a single directory and its contents between multiple computers using The Power Of The Internet™. I was used to using commands like scp to maintain my static blog on the university&rsquo;s servers and the multiple computers that I authored it from, though in 2008 when I moved back to my parents&rsquo; house to write up my PhD I was frustrated that I couldn&rsquo;t work out how to do the same things when the target was a PC running Windows XP.</p></div>

    <div><p>I’m back in the UK so it’s back to posts about albums each month. This one is a bit different because I didn’t listen to very much new stuff while I was away so not all of the albums are up to date. I had to write about the new album by Liars though because it&rsquo;s awesome and I couldn&rsquo;t wait to discuss it! Here’s the list of albums:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tegan and Sarah <em>Heartthrob</em></li>
<li>Fanfarlo <em>Let&rsquo;s Go Extinct</em></li>
<li>Liars <em>Mess</em></li>
<li>London Grammar <em>If You Wait</em></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="tegan-and-sarah-heartthrob">Tegan and Sarah <em>Heartthrob</em></h2>
<p>I would argue, as I have throughout my sequence of <a href="/tags#understated-classics/">understated classics</a> posts, that a great album is one that changes you as a person. Sometimes an album changes your mood consistently, sometimes an album makes you think about the experiences in your life differently, and sometimes an album is just so great and comes along at just the right time to knock you for six. I’d say that in 2014 Tegan and Sara’s “Heartthrob” has been that album for me.</p></div>

    <div><p>Arequipa and Cusco &ndash; the two cities that are the subject of this post &ndash; are probably the two cities in Peru that are most amenable to travellers (though Lima certainly has a lot to offer too). For me they should have been punctuated with a trip to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colca_Canyon">Colca canyon</a>, one of the deepest canyons in the world and twice as deep as the Grand Canyon. Unfortunately, I got really sick on the second day in Arequipa as my attempts at keeping my tummy bug at bay finally failed. (Even so, I didn&rsquo;t actually seek any proper medical help till the second day in Cusco, I was pretty boneheaded about it.)</p></div>

On the first day we took a boat trip out to the Ballestas Islands, a nature reserve that is informally known as “the poor man’s galapagos”. Living there are penguins, sea birds, sea lions and seals. The speed boat out was a little wet and wild (and in fact the return trip was even wetter and wilder) so we all got soaked (twice) but the microclimate around the islands themselves was calm and warm, and we all got good value out of our cameras (if they still worked that is). We even saw a pelican get taken down by a sea-lion which was an interesting if not altogether pleasant display of nature red in tooth and claw. Also, who knew that guano was so valuable?!?</p></div>

The tour took a while to get going (our guide was late) but the exhibition was so amazing (the pieces were painstakingly restored in Germany) that it was hugely enjoyable. The diorama at the end featuring moving animatronic waxworks of Moche people was extremely weird though.</p></div>

    <div><p>We left Misahualli for Baños via an hour in nearby Tena to get something for the truck fixed. After that the drive to Banos was pretty short - or at least it seemed that way as I alternated between dozing off, snapping the scenery and&hellip; well&hellip; dozing off some more. We arrived at a campsite about twenty minutes taxi ride from Banos and this was it, the thing I&rsquo;d feared most about this trip: the camping. Fortunately, as an odd boy, I managed to secure my own tent - the gadget palace that you can see in my selfie! Getting the tent up was straightforward and all my assorted camping gear seemed to live up to requirements! It chucked it down with rain in the night, so it was good that the fly sheet did it&rsquo;s job too. It was great fun to lie there listening to the rain, nice and warm and dry. More importantly, I also managed to get some sleep.</p></div>

    <div><p>I&rsquo;m a bit behind in my posts about the trip and this post interrupts the sequence of events somewhat, just because I&rsquo;ve not felt that well and that has dominated my thoughts about what to write. Basically for a week or two I&rsquo;ve had varying degrees of bellyache and it&rsquo;s not been fun. Instead of feeling the gratitude and excitement I&rsquo;ve felt since being here, I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time wanting to curl up in the corner and just be&hellip; well&hellip; somewhere else.</p></div>

    <div><h3 id="otavalo">Otavalo</h3>
<p>Sunday (24th November) was our first day of travel and involved a four hour trip to Otavalo, a town to the north of Quito that is famous for its market&hellip; on <em>Saturdays</em>. The journey got us better acquainted with travel on our truck Magaly and we encountered a few of the little hiccups that are a natural part of travelling this way: power lines crashing down on to the highway, driver of your truck asking a policeman to take a photo of your truck snagged under the wires, wrong turns, and - funniest of all - getting a whole block&rsquo;s worth of concerned locals to watch as your truck tries to turn a corner. Magaly is a wonderful truck, but subtle she is not!</p></div>
