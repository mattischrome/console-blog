        <p>Nov. 5, 2012</p>
        <p><p>So, two short reviews in a row. I had the day off work and went to see “Rust And Bone” this afternooon. It’s the new film by Jacques Audiard, who directed “A Prophet” – one of my favourite films of the last five years.</p>
<p>“Rust And Bone” is a love story about Ali, a sexually feckless security guard who is struggling to look after his young son on his own, and Stéphanie (played by second most beautiful woman in the world, Marion Cotillard), who is injured while working as a co-ordinator of killer whale displays at an ocenarium. Needless to say it is not a minor injury. The film is basically their love story. I don’t feel so much responsibility to hide plot details about this film because, to be frank, I could type out the whole plot here and it wouldn’t convey the reasons why it’s so great.</p></p>

        <p>Nov. 3, 2012</p>
        <p><p>I went to see &ldquo;Skyfall&rdquo; last night and I really enjoyed it. I knew nothing about the plot, mostly because I had avoided all discussion of the plot with people who had already seen it and I even avoided reviews as so many these days seem to just rattle off plot points, instead of discussing what makes the movie any good. With that in mind I will obviously try not to give away any of the plot in this brief review.</p></p>

        <p>Oct. 31, 2012</p>
        <p><p>It has been a strange month and I found that I didn’t listen to a lot of new music. I have been a bit down and when that’s the case I tend to take refuge in music that I know well, stuff that cheers me up. I have listened to last month’s fave a lot, Nelly Furtado’s “The Spirit Indestructible”. I said a lot of nice things about it but it probably didn’t come over in my writing just how much I really liked it.</p></p>

        <p>Oct. 23, 2012</p>
        <p><p>Tonight, despite feeling a bit under the weather, I went to Stevenage to watch Portsmouth play a League One game at the Lamex Stadium. In addition, I met a “person off the internet” for the second time in a week – this time Tom, a friend of a friend from Facebook: our shared passions being Portsmouth FC and really cool music. We met at King’s Cross and caught a packed train to Stevenage, a non-descript dormitory town that was even more non-descript than I remember St Albans being. I’m glad I went, even though Pompey lost. It’s funny how sitting in a shed in the cold watching your team lose counts as entertainment!</p></p>

        <p><p>This is another mathematics post that does not actually feature any equations or graphs. It is intended to set the way clear for writing regularly about nonlinear systems. This in itself is a precursor to writing more about mathematical biology as biological systems are inherently complex and nonlinear. I am reading <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Nonlinear-Systems-Cambridge-Applied-Mathematics/dp/0521406684/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349212296&amp;sr=8-1">P. G. Drazin’s textbook on Nonlinear Systems</a> and this post is a glossary of terms from the start of the book laid down here because I wanted to remember how to typeset <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_dl.asp">definition lists</a> in Markdown (though in the end I (ab)used <code>&lt;h4&gt;</code> tags because it looked better).</p></p>

        <p>Sep. 29, 2012</p>
        <p><p>I had a bit more time to listen to this month’s albums because I was on holiday for two weeks. I didn’t manage to write about them while on holiday though! In fact I bought and listened to a few more, but I will save them for next month. The albums I will discuss now (in order bought) are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Four Tet “Pink”</li>
<li>The xx “Coexist”</li>
<li>Nelly Furtado “The Spirit Indestructible”</li>
<li>Grizzly Bear “Shields”</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s quite a diverse collection and, Four Tet apart, quite song based.</p></p>

        <p>Sep. 23, 2012</p>
        <p><p>Over my holiday I read &ldquo;Even The Dogs&rdquo; by Jon McGregor. I&rsquo;ve not quite finished it yet but that will at least prevent me from giving away spoilers. I am not sure I would want to give any spoilers anyway because it is unrelentingly grim so far. Perhaps there is a happy  ending but both you and I will have to read it to find out.</p>
<p>I was introduced to Jon McGregor by the book group I was part of during my PhD. I think &ldquo;If Nobody Speaks Of Remarkable Things&rdquo; was the first book I read for the group. At that time of my life, about eight or so years after finishing my English Literature A-level, I had not had to read a book that I had not chosen for myself for quite a long time. I found it to be a complete shock. I can still remember reading about half that book straight out of the amazon packaging.</p></p>

        <p>Sep. 21, 2012</p>
        <p><p>Although I have put off finishing <a href="programming-an-uno-game">my UNO game</a> for over eighteen months, I thought I would get started with another pet project of mine: making a Carcassonne game. This is not a serious affair, there is an excellent app of Carcassonne available for those of you who have iOS devices (it works particularly well on the iPad). The game just strikes me as having the right level of complexity to be a taxing yet attainable project. I’d also like to understand strategies for playing the game and what better way to evaluate strategies for games of chance than to have a simulator to play all those millions of games that you don’t have time to play?</p></p>

        <p>Sep. 19, 2012</p>
        <p><p>It’s rather spooky but shortly after deciding to write about Nelly Furtado’s “Folklore” as the next <a href="understated-classics">understated classic</a>, I found out that she has a new album out this week. As a result, I have been listening to a lot of her music while writing this post, and I’ve been enjoying it too.</p>
<p>As always with these choices of mine, “Folklore” is a record that I can link to particular events and emotions in my life and so I guess my perception of it is coloured by that. Nevertheless while re-listening to the album I tried to examine whether my feelings for it were <em>entirely</em> centred on those memories and emotional responses. I think the answer is not a simple one, because in recent weeks I’ve felt very unsettled in many aspects of my life and so I probably have found it difficult to tell.</p></p>

        <p><p>Album Digest August 2012 is also from the stack of albums that I <a href="album-digest-july-2012">mentioned last month</a>. I chose this selection (along with the Passion Pit album) because the colours looked good together in the mosaic of covers that I make each month. Last month’s digest was about the right amount of detail so this will be another briefer digest. These are all good albums but not ones that will change your life, they&rsquo;ll just happily sit alongside it. They are:</p></p>

        <p><blockquote>
<p>“I see the people working and see it working for them.” (<em>Sat In Your Lap</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Dreaming by Kate Bush is a strange 1982 album that many believed had destroyed her career. Two weeks before her first ever performance of “Running Up That Hill”, <a href="http://www.nme.com/blog/index.php?blog=10&amp;title=on_this_day_kate_bush_releases_hounds_of_1986&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1">the NME had written an editorial asking whether she had burnt herself out completely</a>. Obviously “Running Up That Hill” (recently used to great effect in the Olympic Closing Ceremony) and the parent album “The Hounds Of Love” that followed showed that she had plenty more up her sleeve.</p></p>

        <p><p>“The Gone-Away World” is a novel by Nick Harkaway. It’s about a world slightly askew to our own in which the powers-that-be have deigned to unleash a weapon that simply wipes the enemy out of existence. Unfortunately the enemies also have the same weapon and there are terrible consequences to the extent that the very fabric of reality is threatened. If you don’t already know what reification means, you will by the end.</p></p>
