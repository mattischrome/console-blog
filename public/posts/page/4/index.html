I also rather misanthropically referred to it as a <a href="https://mattischrome.com/posts/the-negativity-casket/">&ldquo;negativity casket&rdquo;</a> because I found that I was pouring a lot of negative feelings into the notebook. It&rsquo;s not really a diary as such because I don&rsquo;t write everyday and I also make other non-diaristic notes, but it does appear to have been something of a process that has helped me to work through my negative feelings.</p></div>

According to my Last.fm annual report, I listened to 51% <em>more</em> music in 2024 compared with 2023 (and 2023 was itself a peak listening year). Moreover, I listened to 709 artists, of which 37% were new discoveries. I listened to over 2 albums a day apparently, with <a href="https://mattischrome.com/posts/2024-albums-03-acopia/">Acopia</a> being the album I listened to most often. Apparently I was the 11th top listener on Last.fm of my number 1 album of the year <a href="https://mattischrome.com/posts/2024-albums-01-bolis-pupul-letter-to-yu/">Letter to Yu by Bolis Pupul</a>.</p></div>

<p>In recent days I have come to a realisation that you also need to try and see things as the computer sees them, rather than expecting it to see what you can see. I was working with some data that were formatted in a pretty way for humans and I was completely flummoxed because I couldn&rsquo;t get <em>any</em> of it into R. The more I stared at the files, the more I began to see all these weird anomalies like completely blank columns that had been shrunk to near zero widths and inconsistencies between files with how the main components of the data were stored. It&rsquo;s been a strange experience!</p></div>

<p>There I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I haven’t taken up meditation at all because the inside of my head is way too noisy. What I did do (at Ingrid’s suggestion) is take up Pilates: I swear by it now. It’s not quite the same as meditation but I’ve found the improvements to my core strength to be quite useful for my mental health.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>This weekend was the 3rd round of the FA Cup, which is when the premier league and championship teams enter the competition. This is the first time for quite a few years where Portsmouth have entered at this stage. Naturally, they&rsquo;re already out! Mind you, in recent years when they&rsquo;ve entered at the first round they haven&rsquo;t made it past those rounds either. That was bad news for one pub in Portsmouth which always made a big show of not taking down their Christmas decorations until Pompey were out of the FA Cup!</p></div>

It investigates themes of place, family, and identity. We are exposed to everywhere all at once but we&rsquo;re also all <em>from</em> somewhere, even if it&rsquo;s somewhere we might not recommend or understand.</p>
<p>Aside from the theme of the album, it&rsquo;s a satisfying and varied electronic album. You have a pop song early on in &ldquo;Completely Half&rdquo; (&ldquo;I thought that I / would fit right in / I&rsquo;m on the border of the state I&rsquo;m in&rdquo;) but the rest of side one is fine electro, peaking with the frenetic &ldquo;Doctor Says&rdquo; and ebbing out with the ringing &ldquo;Spicy Crab&rdquo;. (I realised writing this that the vinyl omits &ldquo;Frogs&rdquo; from the streaming version, but this makes the vinyl version of the album better paced.)</p></div>

    <div><p>&ldquo;Tiger&rsquo;s Blood&rdquo; is a glorious bundle of songs that writhe with brains and heart, with love and friendship, and many other complements and opposites. The music is mostly alternative AOR with a distinct country twang. The lyrics were pretty impenetrable to me, at least until I looked them up online (and they&rsquo;re also on the back of the poster that came with the LP), but they&rsquo;re mostly songs of hope and happiness. It was satisfying to listen to an album this care-free, even if there is a hint of darker times in the background.</p></div>
