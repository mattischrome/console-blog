        <p>Jan. 20, 2023</p>
        <p><p>As with most years, I had hoped to start off 2023 with a flurry of new blog posts. Instead I caught Covid, which knocked me out for most of &lsquo;betweenmas&rsquo; and put paid to my hopes for a productive start to the year. At the time of writing this post, I only just feel like I have begun to get back to &rsquo;normal&rsquo;, or at least as normal as things have been since 2020.</p></p>

        <p>Oct. 29, 2022</p>
        <p><p>Went with my friend Nick to see The Orb at Concord 2 last night. The last time I&rsquo;d seen the Orb was back in 2004, at the start of their relatively dry spell. That night, they&rsquo;d been a bit lacklustre despite playing (some of) the hits and a relatively decent album in &ldquo;Bicycles and Tricycles&rdquo;. I left feeling that I&rsquo;d seen the past rather than the future, something that I wouldn&rsquo;t glimpse again in their records until 2015.</p></p>

        <p>Sep. 14, 2022</p>
        <p><p>Ingrid and I joined our usual quiz team tonight for the residents&rsquo; association pub quiz. As usual we came third. It&rsquo;s a fairly settled group of attendees and we know our level. We&rsquo;re also quite used to the quiz master and his questions, though I do wish he&rsquo;d acknowledge that pop music continued to be a thing long after the sixties!</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always a pot luck round. On one round we get to play a joker which doubles your points. I normally joke that we should play our joker on pot luck. The idea of countering the randomness of the round by getting double points appeals to me. I think we got a full house on pot luck this month, but we had not played our joker! (EDIT: I&rsquo;m informed by Ingrid that we actually got 20/20 on a food and drink round called &lsquo;Five a day&rsquo;.)</p></p>

        <p>Jun. 1, 2022</p>
        <p><p>I began writing this post after realising that it is the first of June and I might as well attempt once more to write a post every day. The speed with which the first of the month comes around, inviting another such promise, always amuses me. But at the moment I am not sure whether this blog will still exist come the end of the month. I think I want to start again in pastures new.</p></p>

        <p>May. 22, 2022</p>
        <p><p>Since moving to an M1 Mac, I&rsquo;ve noticed some issues with my second screen that I do not experience with my previous Intel Mac or with my current work laptop, which is a Dell Intel PC running Windows 10.</p>
<p>I get a lot of flickering on the screen, which is intolerable if I have Pro-motion and True Tone turned on. Note that these are options for the main display rather than the external monitor. I think this means that Apple does not or cannot let you apply these settings granularly, they have to be on or off system-wide.</p></p>

        <p>Mar. 21, 2022</p>
        <p><p>Rosewater is an exciting science fiction novel set several decades after first contact with an alien called Wormwood, that has established itself as a large biodome in Nigeria. The novel follows Kaaro, a thief whose extra special abilities are forged from an unlikely connection with the alien. The whole thing is part sci-fi adventure and part spy novel.</p>
<p>The novel is set in multiple timelines with whole sections of the story told in flashback. This gives a sense of hopping through Kaaro’s memories and helps us explore this strange futuristic vision of Nigeria. It also really helps with pace, first by throwing us into the story and then helping to explain the relationships between the characters we are introduced to.</p></p>

        <p><p>I find it hard to get started on projects. This may have always been the case. I definitely remember instances of complex plans for school projects that I&rsquo;d barely have time to finish. I once got up at 6AM to finish making a calendar in French—I thought it was going to be this outstanding piece of work that would genuinely replace my teacher&rsquo;s calendar! Reality didn&rsquo;t quite match the idea though.</p></p>

        <p>Feb. 26, 2022</p>
        <p><p><em>The Imaginary Girlfriend</em> is a short autobiography by American author John Irving. In it, he explains the interwoven roles of writing and wrestling in his life.</p>
<p>As always with Irving, the book is absorbing from the off, and it&rsquo;s tempting to use the anecdotes here to explain why most of his novels seem to have an underdog narrating them. It&rsquo;s because he loves the work of Dickens so much. I kid. It might be because it is a role he has created for himself, and maybe he likes to write what he knows.</p></p>

        <p>Feb. 8, 2022</p>
        <p><p>Today I had an interesting bug in some Latex code I am writing. Putting a footnote into a caption caused the document to fail compilation. The problem was that this document doesn&rsquo;t use a table of figures at the start, so I hadn&rsquo;t thought to include a short summary caption. Apparently the curly brace in the footnote command does not sit well with that, even if you aren&rsquo;t using a list or table of figures in your document. The solution is simple, as long as the footnote isn&rsquo;t crucial to the list of tables!</p></p>

        <h1><a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/laurent-binet-civilisations/" title="Laurent Binet, Civilisations">Laurent Binet, Civilisations</a></h1>
        <p>Feb. 8, 2022</p>
        <p><p>&lsquo;Civilisations&rsquo; is a counterfactual historical novel that attempts to extrapolate the future course of history after changing one pivotal moment of the timeline. I usually find novels like this are great fun, another entertaining example is &lsquo;Making History&rsquo; by Stephen Fry. The novel, originally written in French, won some big awards in France last year. I read the translation by Sam Taylor.</p>
<p>In &lsquo;Civilisations&rsquo;, Binet makes the pivotal point of his tale, the migration of Erik the Red to America in the late 900s. The idea of the novel is that as the vikings move down the coast of north and Central America, they bring exposure to (and therefore some eventual immunity from) smallpox and the ability to work with iron. This equips and prepares the indigenous people ahead of Christopher Columbus&rsquo; arrival in 1492.</p></p>

        <p>Feb. 5, 2022</p>
        <p><p>Today, we transferred our Christmas tree to a new pot. Being root-bound as the tree was, it took ages to get it out of the crappy pot from the store and into the new, bigger pot. And I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s a bit wonky, which might make the baubles a bit lopsided next Christmas. It looks excellent next to the new bird bath.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it was nice to get another plant into a pot with the hope of keeping it around. Currently, our garden is mostly bulbs erupting from pots. We covered what used to be the lawn in plastic sheeting last December to kill off the grass (and more importantly, the weeds). We had a look underneath it all last weekend, and it&rsquo;s doing the job. It should be possible to continue the next phase of redoing the garden in March (depending on the weather). But it does mean that plant life is currently pot-bound, except for the shed-hugging Jasmine that Ingrid brought back to life a couple of years ago.</p></p>
