    <div><p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27161156-hillbilly-elegy">&ldquo;Hillbilly Elegy&rdquo;</a> is the autobiography of JD Vance, a self-professed hillbilly made good who graduated from Yale Law School. I read it because reviews touted it as illustrating the economic conditions leading to Brexit and the implausible election of Donald Trump. As <a href="space-between-this-and-that">I wrote in an earlier post</a>, I&rsquo;m keen to learn about why Brexit happened. However, I think this book fails to provide an explanation.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I enjoyed the book. It gave me plenty to think about. The story Vance tells is entertaining, but falls short of presenting a meaningful social and economic analysis of the plight of the white working classes.</p></div>

<p>I’ve been stressed. Sometimes this manifests in being unable to sleep. Sometimes it manifests in all my interests and ideas seeming to be completely pointless. Sometimes one of those precedes the other. Sometimes it works vice versa. Often since getting back from Australia I’ve felt stuck in a vicious circle of insomnia and disinterest. Perhaps it’s just been the longest case of jet lag ever.</p></div>

<p>Stretching 151 miles from Torquay (not that one!) to Allansford, the road was deliberately built as a tourist attraction as a means of providing meaningful work for troops returning home from the First World War. Regarded as one of the world&rsquo;s greatest scenic roads, it certainly holds it own against things like the roads I experienced in Chile and Bolivia when I travelled over the Andes.</p></div>

<p>It seemed to last forever but we made it. We left for Heathrow at 6AM and left London at around midday. I waved goodbye to home for nearly four weeks.</p>
<p>We stopped over in Dubai for an hour or so while the plane refuelled. We walked in circles trying to shake off the fatigue. I&rsquo;d equalled one of my longest ever flights just getting to Dubai and now I was facing almost twice as much time again.</p></div>

Also Ingrid and I sat in a restaurant in <a href="https://mattischrome.com/spain-new-year-201718/">Barcelona</a> on January 2nd drinking for the third night in row. We hadn&rsquo;t got off to that great a start. Well today marks the completion of a dry month: dry January with a two day lag.</p>
<p>I also (mostly) managed to keep to my other goal of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/16/case-against-sugar-sweetness-and-blight-rachel-cooke">eliminating sugar</a> from my tea and coffee. This meant I cut out at least three teaspoons of sugar a day for a month. I can&rsquo;t say it was easy. For a while I compensated by hoovering up the post-Christmas chocolates. Then came a period of the blues, though that was probably just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">confirmation bias</a>.

<p>With &ldquo;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s more the former. But I don&rsquo;t have to say anything pretentious about the cinematography or its timeliness. Most people will recognise those elements. Instead, I can say it is a <em>good</em> film. An enjoyable movie. A flat-out entertaining one in fact.</p></div>

A winding drive over steep hills leads you down to a cute bay with the typical white houses and terracotta roofs. All the window frames were painted just the right shade of blue.</p>

<p>The surrealist artist Salvador Dalí lived and worked in the area. This meant a trip to Figueres to see his Theatre-Museum and on new year&rsquo;s eve a walk over the hill to Port Lligat to visit his house. Both required timed tickets. We couldn&rsquo;t get into the Port Lligat house on our first day because there were no tickets left. Lucky for us that New Year&rsquo;s Eve was so much better weather-wise!</p></div>

<p>Some albums are good because a band continues making the music that you love. Some albums are good because a band takes their ideas a step or two further than before. Chalice Hymnal is that rare album that does both of these things.</p>
<p>The references to past albums include the track Deeper Politics and Deep Snow II, and, as per albums past, these tracks evolve slowly out of languid guitar hooks and smoky atmospherics. If it ain’t broke don’t fix it.</p></div>

<p>Sometimes you just want a simple pop song about going out somewhere. I enjoyed the Rolling Blackouts&rsquo; EP &ldquo;The French Press&rdquo;. It contains many catchy tunes <a href="album-digest-march-2017">as I noted in my review</a>. &ldquo;Julie&rsquo;s Place&rdquo; is the best, speaking of a need to be somewhere or a promise that you will go there. Given that I often listen to music between places, it&rsquo;s nice to have a song or two like that on my playlist.</p></div>
