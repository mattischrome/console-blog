        <p>Dec. 19, 2013</p>
        <p><p>I&rsquo;m a bit behind in my posts about the trip and this post interrupts the sequence of events somewhat, just because I&rsquo;ve not felt that well and that has dominated my thoughts about what to write. Basically for a week or two I&rsquo;ve had varying degrees of bellyache and it&rsquo;s not been fun. Instead of feeling the gratitude and excitement I&rsquo;ve felt since being here, I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time wanting to curl up in the corner and just be&hellip; well&hellip; somewhere else.</p></p>

        <p><h3 id="otavalo">Otavalo</h3>
<p>Sunday (24th November) was our first day of travel and involved a four hour trip to Otavalo, a town to the north of Quito that is famous for its market&hellip; on <em>Saturdays</em>. The journey got us better acquainted with travel on our truck Magaly and we encountered a few of the little hiccups that are a natural part of travelling this way: power lines crashing down on to the highway, driver of your truck asking a policeman to take a photo of your truck snagged under the wires, wrong turns, and - funniest of all - getting a whole block&rsquo;s worth of concerned locals to watch as your truck tries to turn a corner. Magaly is a wonderful truck, but subtle she is not!</p></p>

        <p><p>By the time this goes up, I will be at least a week in to my South American tour. I flew out to Ecuador last Thursday (the 21st) and ended up being awake for more than twenty four hours. My flight left London early and I had a three hour stopover in Madrid, then a twelve hour flight onward to Quito. My bag didn&rsquo;t leave Madrid though, so we were separated for about twenty four nerve-racking hours. Luckily, I&rsquo;d packed a change of clothes and so I was still able to explore Quito with Lee and Miriam (fellow Tucan travellers) the next day without too much discomfort.</p></p>

        <p>Oct. 31, 2013</p>
        <p><p>Four great albums this month for the last album digest in a while.</p>
<h2 id="chvrches-the-bones-of-what-you-believe">CHVRCHES &ldquo;The Bones Of What You Believe&rdquo;</h2>
<p>I first got into CHVRCHES on Record Store Day, one of my purchases was an Irn Bru coloured 12&quot; of the Recover EP that, according to eBay, tripled in value over night. Judging by this, their full debut, my see-through orange slab of happiness may hold its value, because it&rsquo;s clear that CHVRCHES should be around for the long haul. &ldquo;The Bones Of What You Believe&rdquo; is a master class in upbeat pop songwriting that doesn&rsquo;t have to pander to the lowest common denominator.</p></p>

        <p>Oct. 21, 2013</p>
        <p><p>As I mentioned <a href="/the-reset-button/">in a previous post</a>, I baked a chocolate cake the other day and it was a great success. Here is the recipe, which is a trivial modification of one that appears in Nigel Slater&rsquo;s &ldquo;Real Food&rdquo; (Amazon links: <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Real-Food-Nigel-Slater/dp/1841151440/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1382362805&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=nigel+slater+real+food">UK</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Real-Food-Nigel-Slater/dp/1841151440/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1382362827&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=nigel+slater+real+food">US</a>). &ldquo;Real Food&rdquo; is a cookbook that I genuinely treasure. The modification I have made for this recipe is to omit the espresso but I will point out where it should be added, in case you want to give that a try.</p></p>

        <p>Oct. 18, 2013</p>
        <p><p>I have mixed feelings about this show. On the one hand, I like that there are depictions of working class Britain on display and I feel that it is right that these paintings are considered part of the British cultural canon. I also like that a lot of these paintings represent large gatherings of people, which are absent from a lot of what we might call the mainstream of art.</p></p>

        <p>Oct. 16, 2013</p>
        <p><h2 id="previously-on">Previously on&hellip;</h2>
<p>I planned this post as a follow-up to one called <a href="/the-truth-about-work/">The Truth About Work</a> from a couple of months ago, but a few things happened that changed my thinking. It has implications for my future and in particular, it redefines what this break from work and upcoming trip means to me.</p>
<p>One of the punchlines to &ldquo;The Truth About Work&rdquo; was that, sometimes, the only way to move ahead is to quit. I originally put it a little more baldly: I said that you <em>always</em> have to quit in order to move on from a sticky situation. Because I knew I was about to quit, I felt I had to write about that decision in unequivocal terms. Obviously I don&rsquo;t think that you should just tap out every single time that things get a little tough. I am not even sure now whether I should have done it at all: hitting the reset button so far in advance of the tour no longer feels like the great idea that it once did. I wasted a lot of the last six weeks and the principal effect of that has been to erode my self-esteem and my bank account.</p></p>

        <p>Oct. 12, 2013</p>
        <p><p>Today I went with a friend to see <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/art-under-attack-histories-british-iconoclasm">Tate Britain&rsquo;s &ldquo;Art Under Attack&rdquo; show</a>. It&rsquo;s an interesting, if uneven, affair that entertains but doesn&rsquo;t quite succeed in everything it attempts to do. The big word that you learn is iconoclasm: the act of attacking an object believed to represent particular beliefs. The show splits into two parts: ideological acts of iconoclasm committed against works of art in Britain and the work of British artists who embrace iconoclasm as a means for making art. The first half (comprising more than half of the show - because I lump together two of the shows sections &ldquo;Religion&rdquo; and &ldquo;Politics&rdquo; into this half) is more interesting and successful than the second (&ldquo;Aesthetics&rdquo;).</p></p>

        <p>Oct. 5, 2013</p>
        <p><p>After a few false starts I managed to finish &ldquo;High-Rise&rdquo;, the next in <a href="j-g-ballard">my collection of JG Ballard novels</a>. For a book that I had trouble getting into, it turned out to be a pretty good read - even if it was also a pretty unpleasant one. Published in 1975, &ldquo;High-Rise&rdquo; is perhaps ahead of its time in exploring the effects of social breakdown in stylised and artificial situations where people are in close contact. You might think the plot, about a luxury high-rise that goes to hell, is in some way political or sociological but it really isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s just a big playground in which Ballard throws around some of his most twisted ideas, all the while remarking on the very artifice of the situation.</p></p>

        <p><p>A nice diverse selection of albums this month:</p>
<ol>
<li>Arctic Monkeys &ldquo;AM&rdquo;</li>
<li>BT &ldquo;A Song Across Wires&rdquo;</li>

<h2 id="arctic-monkeys-am">Arctic Monkeys &ldquo;AM&rdquo;</h2>
<p>This whole review is basically me catching up with the rest of the world and realising that the Arctic Monkeys are ace. To be fair, I did notice how awesome they were at the opening ceremony of the Olympics last year, and I have liked the odd one or two of their singles, but up until now I haven&rsquo;t really wanted to listen to any of their albums. In fact before &ldquo;AM&rdquo;, I already had two (ripped from the CDs of friends) but had never bothered to listen to them.</p></p>

        <p>Sep. 14, 2013</p>
        <p><p>The single biggest fact of life is that you are always going to be alone, you just might not realise it. Listening to The Cardigans&rsquo; excellent 2003 &ldquo;Long Gone Before Daylight&rdquo; will help you see that all our relationships are essentially screwed &ndash; but at least it sounds great while it does so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long Gone Before Daylight&rdquo; (&ldquo;Long Gone Before Daylight&rdquo;) plays the role of &ldquo;The Empire Strikes Back&rdquo; in a trilogy of great albums that The Cardigans released between 1999 (the arguably better and slightly happier &ldquo;Gran Turismo&rdquo;) and 2006 (the unarguably inferior and definitely happier &ldquo;Super Extra Gravity&rdquo;). &ldquo;Long Gone Before Daylight&rdquo; has more of a country sound than &ldquo;Gran Turismo&rdquo; or &ldquo;Super Extra Gravity&rdquo;, which meant that I ignored it for a long time: until the disintegration and failure of several relationships convinced me of its brilliance.</p></p>

        <p><p>Ellen Gallagher is an American artist and her &ldquo;AxME&rdquo; show recently finished at the Tate Modern. I went along a few weeks ago and have only now had a bit of time to write up my thoughts.</p>
<p>My biggest regret is that I didn&rsquo;t go along to it sooner, so that I had a chance to see it more than once. It was certainly a larger show than I was expecting (it was about the size of the <a href="ibrahim-el-salahi-at-tate-modern">Ibrahim El-salahi</a> and <a href="choucair-at-tate-modern">Saloua Choucair</a> shows put together) and I hadn&rsquo;t left myself with a lot of time to see everything when I did go.</p></p>
