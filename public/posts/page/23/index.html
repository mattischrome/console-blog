<p>I’m a big fan of both Karl Hyde’s work with Underworld and of Brian Eno’s stuff so Someday World seemed like a dream collaboration to me when it was released last May. I was a bit underwhelmed by it, to the point of overlooking it for <a href="/album-digest-may-2014/">May’s album digest</a>. Last month they released a follow-up called High-Life, which includes some of the more experimental tracks they’d worked on. Together the two albums are greater than the some of their parts, so I’m writing about both of them together this month.</p></div>

Perhaps that tells you everything you need to know about this book, which is slimmer than Murakami&rsquo;s recent efforts. The plot begins with an intriguing premise. Tsukuru is part of a group of close friends and is one day expelled from the group for no reason. Unfortunately, the development of the plot is uncontrolled and by the end  of novel too many holes have developed for it all to hold together.</p></div>

<p><a href="http://www.ulyssesapp.com">Ulysses</a> is a <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a> editor for the Mac. It has a simple drafting model that makes it easy to organise ideas and move between them. Pieces of writing are represented as sheets that can be tagged and grouped together - the grouping can be made manually or using filters. There are no files, the sheets are entries in a single database that is synced with iCloud. Because everything is plain text it won’t eat up your storage space. Individual sheets can be archived for use with Mac Os X’s versions feature.</p></div>

<p>If you are familiar with Wilco’s first few albums, you’ll know that A Ghost Is Born is on the line of best fit through Being There, Summerteeth, and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. It continues its predecessor’s experimentation, but also gets reined in a little. Great songs - some of my favourite Wilco songs - were left off Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (“<a href="http://www.bemydemon.org/songs/venus.htm">Venus Stopped The Train</a>”, “<a href="http://wilcoworld.net/#!/song/a-magazine-called-sunset/">A Magazine Called Sunset</a>”) so the follow-up could easily have been more of the same and everyone would have gone home happy.</p></div>

So much for exploration. We waited out the downpour in a pizza place and deliberated over whether to buy souvenier snaps from the tour guides. Ironically for a town named after hot waters, it was bitterly cold. One of those places where the sound of running water follows you wherever you go, the best thing about it was the huge trains that ran down the middle of street - big clanking hulks pulling huge passenger trains.</p></div>

<blockquote>
<p>I suppose I am distinguishing between found sound and vocal samples here. Perhaps there is very little difference, or that one is the other? When is a vocal snippet something more than found sound? Is it the fact that one has meaning? Isn’t a “meaningless” sample - like the ones here in Russian that I can’t understand - little more than found sound anyway?</p></div>

This is her last novel and is a remarkable book: inventive, funny, and sad, all at once. I found it in a special selection at the local library dedicated to Brazil because of the World Cup.</p>
<p>First some biography. Born Chaya Lispector in Chechelnyk, Ukraine, in 1920, her family escaped the pogroms and emigrated to Brazil in 1922. She was given the new name Clarice as the family settled in <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/brazil/the-northeast/maceio">Maceió in north-eastern Brazil</a>. Later she and her family moved to Rio de Janeiro<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and she started law school there in 1937. Her first published short story appeared around 5 years later.</p></div>

    <div><p><em>Finally</em> saw Guardians of the Galaxy today. Here are fifteen observations about the film that may or may not constitute a short review.</p>
<ol>
<li>At least two Oscars for <a href="http://media.comicbook.com/uploads1/2014/07/guardians-of-the-galaxy-gamora-101682-101718.jpg">Best Use Of Body Paint (Green)</a> and <a href="http://images.radiotimes.com/namedimage/Karen_Gillan_takes_on_Zoe_Saldana_in_extended_Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_trailer.jpg?quality=85&amp;mode=crop&amp;width=620&amp;height=374&amp;404=tv&amp;url=/uploads/images/original/53103.jpg">Best Use Of Body Paint (Blue)</a> are sewn up.</li>
<li>Chris Pratt basically plays Star Lord as “<a href="http://parksandrecreation.wikia.com/wiki/Andy_Dwyer">Andy Dwyer</a> in space” and this is fine by me.</li>
<li>Best movie to feature <a href="http://www.etonline.com/movies/148845_bradley_cooper_explains_his_voice_guardians_of_the_galaxy/">a talking raccoon</a> in a long time.</li>
<li><a href="http://screenrant.com/thor-2-dark-world-mid-post-credits-button-scenes-explained">Watching the entirety of the end credits of Thor 2</a> paid off!</li>
<li>“<em>WE</em> are <a href="https://uk.yahoo.com/movies/dancing-baby-groot-clip-guardians-of-the-galaxy-94738291414.html">Groot</a>” — aren’t we just?! All of the feels.</li>
<li>It features a dance off as a major event, something that it shares with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Step_Up_(film_series)">Step Up movies</a>. Guardians of the Galaxy is a waaaay better movie.</li>
<li>The first words of the credits are <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/1887915/guardians-of-the-galaxy-sequel/">“The Guardians of the Galaxy will return”</a>. It is in fact a movie that reviews itself.</li>
<li>The 3D version might have been pretty good. I watched the 2D version but <a href="http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Guardians-Galaxy-Has-Something-Special-Planned-Its-IMAX-3D-43350.html">the scenes with lots of action <em>might</em> be improved with a bit of depth</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/11033572/Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Awesome-Mix-soundtrack-tops-Billboard-chart.html">A great soundtrack</a>, but there is a cheesy “smooth rock wins chicks” bit that’s a little icky half way through.</li>
<li>That said, the description of the legend of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087277/">Footloose</a> is hilarious. Especially the callback toward the end of the movie.</li>
<li>I especially enjoyed the scene with <a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-easter-eggs-quotes/">the Collector</a>.</li>
<li>Karen Gillen is wasted as Nebula, but <a href="http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Nebula-Return-Guardians-Galaxy-2-66648.html">hopefully she will be back</a>. Karen’s also in what may well be <a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/selfie">one of the most ill-conceived TV shows of all time</a> later this autumn.</li>
<li>I thought it was Bruce Willis playing <a href="http://whatculture.com/wwe/batista-praised-role-guardians-galaxy-movie.php">Drax the Destroyer</a> (I’m useless at this guess the actor game). I loved his taking things literally: “Nothing goes over my head. My reflexes are too fast, I would catch it.”</li>
<li>If you text me at any point in the next month, I will probably reply with <a href="http://www.nerdist.com/2014/08/translate-any-website-into-groot-speak-with-this-nifty-new-button/">“I am Groot”</a>.</li>
<li>No Raccoons or tree creatures were harmed during the making of this film.</li>

    <div><h2 id="or-at-least-its-subversive-soundtrack">Or at least its subversive soundtrack…</h2>
<p>I listened to The Orb’s amazing live album “Live ’93” the other day (after discovering the insipid “History Of The Future” collection on Spotify) and I was amazed at how countercultural and subversive it was. I was listening to this stuff at the age of 14 and now that I’m old enough to be a parent, that makes me a bit uncomfortable. Actually it does nothing of the sort, because it&rsquo;s frigging awesome.</p></div>

    <div><blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you about punk rock: punk rock is a word used by dilettantes and ah&hellip; and ah&hellip; heartless manipulators about music that takes up the energies and the bodies and the hearts and the souls and the time and the minds of young men who give what they have to it and give everything they have to it and it&rsquo;s a&hellip; it&rsquo;s a term that&rsquo;s based on contempt, it&rsquo;s a term that&rsquo;s based on fashion, style, elitism, satanism and everything that&rsquo;s rotten about rock &rsquo;n&rsquo; roll. I don&rsquo;t know <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/John_Lydon">Johnny Rotten</a> but I&rsquo;m sure&hellip; I&rsquo;m sure he puts as much blood and sweat into what he does as <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud">Sigmund Freud</a> did. You see, what sounds to you like a big load of trashy old noise is in fact the brilliant music of a genius, myself . And that music is so powerful that it&rsquo;s quite beyond my control and ah&hellip; when I&rsquo;m in the grips of it I don&rsquo;t feel pleasure and I don&rsquo;t feel pain, either physically or emotionally. Do you understand what I&rsquo;m talking about? Have you ever felt like that? When you just couldn&rsquo;t feel anything and you didn&rsquo;t want to either. You know? Like that? Do you understand what I&rsquo;m saying sir? (Iggy Pop, Canadian TV, March 11th 1977.)</p></div>

    <div><p>The hat in question is a Wilco baseball cap that I bought at a gig of theirs in 2004, the night that Germany got eliminated from Euro 2004. I&rsquo;d love to show you a picture of it but I can&rsquo;t, there isn&rsquo;t even a picture of it from a Wilco merch site: at least not one that Google or Bing images can see anyway. I did manage to find a side-on picture of it in my bedroom in 2005 and zoom right in on it like they do in CSI.</p></div>

I did not know anything about Hundred Waters before this month: &ldquo;The Moon Rang Like A Bell&rdquo; is their second album. In fact second albums by bands I know nothing about are a something of theme because &ldquo;Sunbathing Animal&rdquo; is Parquet Courts&rsquo; sophomore effort and I don&rsquo;t know anything about them either. Meanwhile, I&rsquo;ve meant to write about &ldquo;The Four Seasons Recomposed&rdquo; since April.</p></div>
