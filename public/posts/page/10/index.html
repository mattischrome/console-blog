        <p>Oct. 30, 2017</p>
        <p><p>&ldquo;Like a Mule Bringing Ice Cream to the Sun&rdquo; is a novella by <a href="http://www.sarahladipomanyika.com">Sarah Ladipo Manyika</a>. Of all the books nominated for the 2016 Goldsmiths Prize, this looked like the most interesting to my eyes. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed previous Goldsmiths nominated novels including <a href="acts-of-the-assassins-richard-beard">Acts of the Assassins</a> and <a href="satin-island-tom-mccarthy-review">Satin Island</a>.</p>
<p>The title comes from a poem by <a href="https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/mary-ruefle">Mary Ruefle</a> called &ldquo;Donkey On&rdquo;. You can read it <a href="http://thegreatnothingof1987.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/donkey-on-by-mary-ruefle.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a Mule&hellip;&rdquo; is set in contemporary San Francisco and takes the form of multiple first person narratives, centred around Dr. Morayo da Silva, an elderly Nigerian woman who is approaching her 75th birthday. The novel explores old age, memory, and how we use those things as a filter through which we perceive ourselves and others.</p></p>

        <p>Oct. 29, 2017</p>
        <p><p>Perhaps in today&rsquo;s modern age of streaming and such, <a href="http://thecoral.co.uk">The Coral</a> would be a bigger band and may have survived their eventual burnout. Their work ethic was evident from the start, as rumours swirled <a href="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/YdkAAOSwfl9XBSiR/s-l300.jpg">in the NME</a> about a fantastic new band from Liverpool who were going to blow everybody&rsquo;s socks off. I went to see them live in Bristol after they&rsquo;d released three EPs and they were incredible. Their sound, a bit like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071615/">the movie &ldquo;Holy Mountain&rdquo;</a> set to pop music, imagined a Merseybeat channelled from an alternative universe in which Lennon and McCartney took their acid in <a href="https://www.desertusa.com/mojave-desert.html">the Mojave desert</a> rather than in the English suburbs. Yes, it was derivative but somehow it also managed to be utterly new and compelling.</p></p>

        <p>Oct. 15, 2017</p>
        <p><p><a href="iceland-part-one">After a day on foot in Reykjavík</a>, and with some trepidation, we returned to the car for our drive through Iceland&rsquo;s countryside. We started by heading out on route 1, which is like Iceland&rsquo;s M25 except that it encircles an entire country <em>and</em> about thirty times fewer people. We went to house of Nobel Prize winner Halldór Laxness, only to be turned away because it was being renovated and wouldn&rsquo;t open for another month. Undeterred, we pressed on toward <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Eingvellir">Þingvellir</a>, stopping off on the way to take pictures at a viewpoint. It was just crazy, a flat expanse of undisturbed snow. Just as with the drive from the airport, the territory should have been relentlessly bleak but instead we got a winter wonderland.</p></p>

        <p><p>We went to see the <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/georgia-okeeffe">Georgia O&rsquo;Keeffe exhibition at the Tate Modern</a> last year. At the time, I didn&rsquo;t know much about her, other than the fact she was famous for painting flowers. And that people get a bit hot under the collar about what those paintings might represent. Was the art world of the 1920s and 1930s so repressed that it managed to get into a lather about some paintings of flowers? And more importantly, are they any good?</p></p>

        <p>Oct. 6, 2017</p>
        <p><p><a href="http://approachingpavonis.blogspot.co.uk">Alistair Reynolds&rsquo;</a> 2000 novel &ldquo;Revelation Space&rdquo; has long been in orbit of my science fiction &ldquo;to read&rdquo; list, but it wasn&rsquo;t until one sleepless night (post <a href="command-and-control">&ldquo;Command and Control&rdquo;</a>) that I came across it in Ingrid&rsquo;s audiobooks. I was instantly drawn in as I listened to the opening scene about an archaeological dig facing evacuation ahead of an imminent &lsquo;razor storm&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Revelation Space&rdquo; is <a href="http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/hard_sf">hard sci-fi</a> set in a universe where the speed of light cannot be exceeded. Most of the action takes place in the 26th century, with the narrative also recounting earlier events as the story progresses. Humanity has expanded to five or six systems beyond our current solar system, using huge colony ships that travel at 99.9% of the speed of light. This means that <a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/everyday-myths/relativity10.htm">relativistic effects</a> play an important role in the narrative. A lot is made of the difference between sleeping away the decades between star systems and subjectively experiencing them.</p></p>

        <p><p>I love making plots in R with <code>ggplot</code>. However, there are always a few niggles that I forget about between plots. I wrote this post so that I have somewhere to look the next time I need to tweak a few things in my plots. I intend to come back and add updates in the future as I learn more things. If I keep coming back, I might also remember a few of these too.</p></p>

        <p>Oct. 4, 2017</p>
        <p><p>We arrived in Reykjavík a few days <a href="https://weather.com/news/news/reykjavik-iceland-record-snowfall-february">after a monumental snowstorm</a>. As such the city was still under at least six inches of snow. We collected the hire car from the airport and drove out of Keflavik. The scenery normally looks like a moonscape, but for us it was a frosty white wonderland.</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/images/iceland/iceland_01.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>After about an hour&rsquo;s drive, we arrived at the Hotel Nattura. From the outside it looks like a huge secondary school but as soon as you step inside it&rsquo;s warm and comfortable. This is quite good when you&rsquo;ve just parked next to a snow bank that&rsquo;s two and half metres tall and then bambi&rsquo;d it in over the icy paths with your luggage.</p></p>

        <p>Oct. 3, 2017</p>
        <p><p>I had low expectations for &ldquo;Hello America&rdquo;, the next in <a href="j-g-ballard">the series of Ballard novels</a> that I started reading over seven years ago. However, it turned out to be a hoot. A couple of years ago, this novel would have been a wig-out bit of standard Ballard weirdness (a bit like <a href="the-drowned-world">&ldquo;The Drowned World&rdquo;</a> or <a href="the-crystal-world">&ldquo;The Crystal World&rdquo;</a>) but given recent events &ldquo;Hello America&rdquo; is starting to take on an eerie prescience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello America&rdquo; (1981) is set a hundred years from now in an alternate time-line where oil production peaked in the late sixties. Without a viable energy supply the North American continent depopulates and the Russians dam the Bering strait in order to turn Siberia into farmland to feed the American refugees. Meanwhile, the continental United States turns into a desert wasteland due to the resulting climate change. The 44th president (President Brown) was the last before America depopulated entirely.</p></p>

        <p>Oct. 1, 2017</p>
        <p><p>Ingrid and I got married a month ago. It was a lovely day. We had a simple ceremony with two witnesses, our friends Sue and Andrew. We kept it quiet and small, as we just wanted to be married without too much fuss. A month on, we&rsquo;re happy to report that we are glad we did it.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;d like to thank everyone who nonetheless sent cards and gifts, and to all of those who wished us well on Facebook. Much as I&rsquo;m wary of social networks this did seem to be one of those events to which an announcement on Facebook was well suited. We intend to have additional celebrations at some point in the near future so keep your eyes peeled. We&rsquo;re aware that our little dyad cannot be the only point where our families intersect. We hope to overcome that, but it is those sorts of complications that drove us to a smaller scale event in the first place. I&rsquo;m very keen on the &lsquo;win the lottery and hire a few private jets&rsquo; approach but they keep selling me faulty tickets.</p></p>

        <p><p>&ldquo;Command and Control&rdquo; by Eric Schlosser is about the history of nuclear weapons and their safety. This might not seem like a thrilling subject, but it&rsquo;s absorbing from start to finish. I started it three years ago but only finished it more recently as the subject of nuclear weapons has become more pertinent to current affairs<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.

        <p>Sep. 28, 2017</p>
        <p><p>We bought a cheap package holiday in the British Airways Black Friday sale. The weekend spanned Ingrid&rsquo;s birthday, so it was ideal. £99 each for flights and a hotel, and we bagged a hire car quite cheaply too.</p>
<p>Because our flight was from Heathrow and the trains from Chichester are both expensive and inconvenient for early flights, we spoiled ourselves with a taxi to the airport. It felt very strange to be whisked through the Sussex and Surrey countryside at six am on a Friday morning!</p></p>
