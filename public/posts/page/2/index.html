        <p>Jan. 31, 2025</p>
        <p><p>While off sick and under the weather I decided to play around with presenting the photos on this blog in a fashion more in keeping with the current Hugo theme.</p>
<p>I used <a href="https://imagemagick.org">Imagemagick</a> to process the same files from <a href="/posts/in-praise-of-paris/">the Paris post</a> earlier this week. I made them a bit smaller, reduced the number of colours to 256, posterized them (a built-in Imagemagick function that groups colours), and then did a dither on them.</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 30, 2025</p>
        <p><p>When making my albums of the year posts at the start of the month, I realised that compared to many other critics lists, there was no sign of <em>Brat</em> by Charlie XCX. And when it came up again on my album shuffle the other day, I  thought I should re-evaluate the album and whether it should have made my list.</p>
<p>Listening to <em>Brat</em> again for this post, it was clear that I&rsquo;d missed out on something special. This was partly because I went for a walk with it on my headphones and that always lets me hear the details of the music. I think too many times when this album came on at home, it would be a little bit too doof-doof to be background music. These are songs that do demand (and deserve) a bit of attention.</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 29, 2025</p>
        <p><p>Dora Carrington was an artist loosely affiliated with the Bloomsbury Group and noted for her unconventional lifestyle. Despite a short career, her work had a great impact and <a href="https://pallant.org.uk/whats-on/dora-carrington/">a retrospective at the Pallant House Gallery in Chichester</a> brings together some of her major works.</p>
<p>I was a bit confused at the start of the show, as I had got my Carrington&rsquo;s wrong! I&rsquo;d been thinking this was a show about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonora_Carrington">Leonora Carrington</a> who was active later, initially in circles with Max Ernst, and later on in her own right in Mexico City. I will have to wait for a retrospective of her work another time.</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 28, 2025</p>
        <p><p>Thai Green Curry is one of our favourites. Often when we are travelling we will find a Thai restaurant and order it. It&rsquo;s a nice way to see how a familiar dish is rendered in your new surroundings. More importantly, it&rsquo;s a dish that&rsquo;s reliably gluten and tomato free.</p>
<h3 id="paste-ingredients">Paste ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>8 g coriander roots</li>
<li>1 tsp coriander powder</li>
<li>1/2 tsp cumin powder</li>
<li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
<li>1/2 tsp turmeric powder</li>
<li>1 tsp galangal</li>
<li>1 tsp minced or grated ginger</li>
<li>3 shredded kefir lime leaves</li>
<li>1 tbsp minced lemon grass</li>
<li>1 tsp salt</li>
<li>2 tsp brown sugar</li>
<li>1 minced long green chilli</li>
<li>1 1/2 tbsp canola oil</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="paste-method">Paste Method</h3>
<p>Blitz all the above ingredients together into a paste, using a food processor or a pestle and mortar. For the latter, you will need to do this in batches.</p></p>

        <p><p>This time last year, Ingrid and I were on the Eurostar to Paris for four days. We did so much in our time there that I couldn&rsquo;t write about it at the time. Here&rsquo;s a little summary with a few photos.</p>
<p>Our chief aim was to take in as much Rodin as possible (as he&rsquo;s Ingrid&rsquo;s favourite sculptor) so on the Saturday we set out for Montparnasse and struck out for Meudon, where his house is. And&hellip; it was closed for winter!</p></p>

        <p><p>I want to start making generative art again. I can&rsquo;t say I ever did it that seriously but using programming languages to generate &lsquo;art&rsquo; is a pretty fun to while away the hours, especially when one&rsquo;s talents for drawing truculently refuse to improve. Of course, more recently the phrase generative art might be said to have grown to encompass the GPT-class models that generate images from prompts. So what would be the point of coding something, when you can make &lsquo;proper&rsquo; art?</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 25, 2025</p>
        <p><p>Summer 1954 is a pair of one-act plays by Sir Terrence Rattigan that are currently being performed together at the Chichester Festival Theatre. I really enjoyed both plays.</p>
<h3 id="table-number-seven">Table Number Seven</h3>
<p>The first play is <em>Table Number Seven</em>, which is set in a boarding hotel in Bournemouth. We&rsquo;re gradually introduced to a cast of characters - mostly elderly ladies - who are staying there. One of them, the major, who in a Fawlty Towers way won&rsquo;t shut up once you get talking to him, is particularly interested in an article in an obscure local paper.</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 24, 2025</p>
        <p><p>Ian MacDonald&rsquo;s &ldquo;Revolution in the Head&rdquo; is a book that I&rsquo;ve read parts of dozens of times and even all the way through once or twice. I picked it up again today and thought I would write about it. It&rsquo;s a detailed analysis of every Beatles song ever released, along with the details and events of their recording. I own a copy of the second edition which was updated to include the anthology material. Today you can still get hold of <a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/revolution-in-the-head/ian-macdonald/9780099526797">a 3rd edition on the Waterstones website</a> (not sure that I like the new cover though).</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 23, 2025</p>
        <p><p>An album that arrived a bit too late to be considered in the best of the year list, <em>Strawberry Hotel</em> by Underworld is a solid effort. Their 11th album, it remarks their return to the format after five years after the <em>Drift</em> series in 2019.</p>
<p><em>Drift</em> had been an interesting experiment where Underworld had tried to put out a new track each week and grouping several weeks worth into EPs before putting out a massive 6+ hour box set. The striking thing about the project was that it was so good. They released a sampler edition of the album which cherry picked the best songs, but almost every track released as part of <em>Drift</em> could be swapped into that sampler.</p></p>

        <p><p>One of the absurd barriers to writing regularly is that my new post script is written to open the new markdown file in Neovim and until this week I had no idea how to type a hashtag (which markdown uses for headers) in this editor.</p>
<p>Neovim, and its venerable predecessors vi and vim, is notorious for being a bit tricksy to work with. This is because it is a modal editor: you use keys to switch the editor between modes. The same key presses mean different things in different modes, which can be frustrating when you first start out and have no clue what is going on.</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 21, 2025</p>
        <p><p>We had great success with our sticky toffee pudding as a Christmas Day dessert. It&rsquo;s a hybrid of a recipe by Jamie Oliver, one that we found in a gluten free cookbook, and one for <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/sticky_toffee_pudding_25161">a make-ahead pudding by the hairy bikers</a>.</p>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<h3 id="pudding">Pudding</h3>
<ul>
<li>200-250g chopped dates</li>
<li>200ml boiling water (or tea)</li>
<li>100g softened unsalted butter</li>
<li>1 teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda</li>
<li>170g sugar (85g golden caster, 50g light soft brown, 35g dark soft brown)</li>
<li>170g self-raising flour</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon mixed spice</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
<li>2 eggs (room temperature)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sauce">Sauce</h3>
<ul>
<li>110g unsalted butter</li>
<li>110g sugar (half light soft brown sugar, half dark soft brown sugar)</li>
<li>140ml double cream</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="method">Method</h2>
<h3 id="pudding-1">Pudding</h3>
<ol>
<li>Soak the chopped dates in the boiling water with the bicarbonate of soda for 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Mash the dates with a fork.</li>
<li>Cream the butter and sugar.</li>
<li>Add the eggs and flour and spices.</li>
<li>Mix the dates in to the batter and spoon into a greased baking dish.</li>
<li>Cook for 45 minutes at 180˚C. Check with a skewer and if it comes out with batter on, return to the oven for 5-10 minutes.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="sauce-1">Sauce</h3>
<ol>
<li>Add all the ingredients to a small pan and cook together on a low heat. Stir gently initially.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you remove the stones from your dates!</li>
<li>We did this as a make-ahead for Christmas day. When we made the sauce at the same time as we made the sponge and poured about a third over the top. We let it all cool before storing in the fridge. We reheated for about 20 minutes at 180˚C and microwaved the sauce.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s very nice (but also incredibly over-indulgent!) served with vanilla ice cream.</li>
<li>The reason for using a mixture of sugars is both for the colour (more dark sugar makes for a more appealing toffee sauce) and for the overall toffee/caramel taste of the pudding. You can change the ratios here to suit your own tastes.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a fairly lenient recipe so don&rsquo;t get too hung up on exact quantities.</li>

        <p>Jan. 20, 2025</p>
        <p><p>Around this time last year, I wrote in praise of writing a diary. I also rather misanthropically referred to it as a <a href="https://mattischrome.com/posts/the-negativity-casket/">&ldquo;negativity casket&rdquo;</a> because I found that I was pouring a lot of negative feelings into the notebook. It&rsquo;s not really a diary as such because I don&rsquo;t write everyday and I also make other non-diaristic notes, but it does appear to have been something of a process that has helped me to work through my negative feelings.</p></p>
