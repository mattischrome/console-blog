    <div><p>Acopia are a band from Melbourne Australia with that time honoured line up of one girl and two guys. This eponymous album is their second and it&rsquo;s full of slinky electronic ballads that echo classic 90s trip hop. It&rsquo;s got that same downtempo downbeat vibe, the sorts of songs that revel in sadness but also the joy of a killer bass line.</p>
<p>This album was actually released in November 2023 but I first heard it in January 2024 after reading a glowing review of it. I can remember the first time listening to it, I took the train to see my parents in to hand over a present I&rsquo;d bought for my nephew. (Fittingly, it&rsquo;s his birthday today.)</p></div>

    <div><p>One album that&rsquo;s lurking in the periphery of my <a href="">understated classics series</a> is &ldquo;Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe In You&rdquo; by Big Thief. &ldquo;Bright Future&rdquo; is the latest solo album by Big Thief singer-songwriter Adrianne Lenker and it is just as good. Intimate and intricate, it draws the listener in as Adrianne sings live with a very small band. At times you can hear breaths drawn and the sound feels like a small space that you are cocooned in: this could be sound engineering (spatial audio would have us believe anything is possible) but it&rsquo;s most likely equipment set up intelligently in a cosy studio.</p></div>

    <div><p>It&rsquo;s interesting that an album sung entirely in Italian ended up being one of my favourites of the year, but perhaps not surprising given well written and arranged these songs are. They&rsquo;re just the right side of electro-pop but also with an air of sophistication.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t speak Italian but I do speak some romance languages, so I can sort of guess what the titles might mean. &ldquo;La Notte&rdquo; is &ldquo;The Night&rdquo;, &ldquo;Il Bucchi Neri&rdquo; is &ldquo;The Black Holes&rdquo; (I&rsquo;d thought it was the black mouths but I guess I was close!), and so on. As the for the lyrics, they&rsquo;re catching enough for me to sing a phonetic version of them to myself on many occasions, though I&rsquo;ve no idea what meaning I&rsquo;ve been mangling!</p></div>

    <div><p>I don&rsquo;t know very much about MGMT these days. I haven&rsquo;t read any interviews about their albums. The video to the single &ldquo;Nothing to Declare&rdquo; was brought to my attention by the YouTube channel Justin Hawkins Rides Again. In it he points out how melodically interesting the song is. To be honest I was more than a little bit in love with the video.</p>
<p>After that I added the album to my library and heard a few more singles in the run up to the release of the album, including &ldquo;Bubblegum Dog&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mother Nature&rdquo;. The album itself is crammed with similarly interesting songs and has a circular structure, beginning with part 2 of the title track. I&rsquo;d love to know what poem is being read or sampled or cut up on &ldquo;Loss of Life, Pt. 2&rdquo;. Other highlights include &ldquo;Phradie&rsquo;s Song&rdquo; and a song called &ldquo;Nothing Changes&rdquo; which goes a bot bonkers in the second half, completely undermining the title of the song!</p></div>

    <div><p>Nonetheless is the fifteenth album by the Pet Shop Boys. As seems to be a common theme with this top 10 so far, it&rsquo;s an album that initially underwhelmed me. Well, perhaps &ldquo;underwhelmed&rdquo; is a little unfair, it was more that it didn&rsquo;t seem to have much to it to distinguish it from their previous albums, and there have been some palpable duds in the previous fourteen.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, this album is definitely a grower. As I&rsquo;ve gotten to know some of the songs, I&rsquo;ve come to appreciate the little details strewn throughout. For example, the lovely little rave riff that breaks into the bridge on &ldquo;Loneliness&rdquo;, something that turns a potentially stern song into something a lot more fun.</p></div>

    <div><p>Yard Act are a post-punk band from Leeds. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s My Utopia?&rdquo; is their second album. I first encountered Yard Act in a review of this album, which sent me to look at the excellent video to their non-album single &ldquo;The Trenchcoat Museum&rdquo;. I enjoyed the metatextual references both in the video and the song, so I eagerly added &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s My Utopia?&rdquo; to my library.</p>
<p>However, the album took a while to win me over. Fourth-wall breaking asides and meta references are fine in a single song, even one as long as &ldquo;The Trenchcoat Museum&rdquo;, but combined over the length of a whole album, it can be a bit off-putting. Nevertheless, WMU? rewards repeat listens (especially on headphones) because it&rsquo;s genuinely funny - I think comedy is an underrated quality in Indie music - and the songs themselves are ace.</p></div>

But Gary&rsquo;s moping about after the Satsuma lady doing a runner while he was in the loo will have to be put on hold when his friend turns up dead.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed this book. It&rsquo;s not going to win any prizes for quality of writing but it is both fun and funny. There are a few repetitive phrases and at one point beers magically become lagers in the space of three paragraphs. The writing is very colloquial but there is a point-of-view shift at the start of part two that deploys some writerly skill. (This short-lived though as the new point-of-view soon collapses down into one similar to the main character.)</p></div>

    <div><p>Welcome to the new look for my blog. I&rsquo;ve had my eye on a more minimal look for a while now. Whether this new look is successful or not depends on how often I write new posts. To that end, this theme also supports a separate (or almost separate) stream of photos. Once I&rsquo;ve got back in to the habit of putting photos up, that should be a nice additional stream of content.</p></div>

    <div><p>Once upon a time, a cat named Nerys ripped into the bottom of our sofa to make herself a cozy burrow. This was all well and good, except for the times when she would do it when we were using the sofa too. On these occasions (and presumably on most others) she would proceed to sharpen her claws on what remained of the fabric. (A less charitable reason for this behaviour would be that she was simply widening the whole for her future self after eating more and more kibbles!)</p></div>
