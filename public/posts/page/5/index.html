        <p>Jan. 14, 2024</p>
        <p><p>Once upon a time, a cat named Nerys ripped into the bottom of our sofa to make herself a cozy burrow. This was all well and good, except for the times when she would do it when we were using the sofa too. On these occasions (and presumably on most others) she would proceed to sharpen her claws on what remained of the fabric. (A less charitable reason for this behaviour would be that she was simply widening the whole for her future self after eating more and more kibbles!)</p></p>

        <p><p>One of the things that people tend to start around this time of year is a diary. They usually get filled for as long as your new year&rsquo;s resolutions last.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;ve been writing in my current diary for a while. It&rsquo;s a Moleskine extra large ruled Notebook in beautiful Prussian Blue, covered in whatever stickers pass over my desk. (Hint: find my address and send me stickers Internet.) This is much more preferable to a &lsquo;real&rsquo; diary because I can leave a few days and then resume. I can also take breaks and write out a bunch of notes on Org-mode or the Julia programming language if I want to (and yes, I did).</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 11, 2024</p>
        <p><p>There was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/23998379/google-search-seo-algorithm-webpage-optimization">an excellent article on The Verge yesterday about how Google is transforming the kinds of sites and blogs that are on the internet</a>. I also read <a href="https://www.fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/where-have-all-the-websites-gone/">this slightly more personal take by Jason Velasquez</a>, which is more about how social networks have gobbled up all the time and attention of people who might otherwise be making interesting web sites. This has made me think deeply about what this blog is <em>for</em>, and why I might continue to blog in Twenty Twenty Four.</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 10, 2024</p>
        <p><p>When <a href="/2023-albums-07-maara-ancient-truth">I wrote about Maara&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Ancient Truth&rdquo;</a> over Christmas as part of my albums of the year rundown, I mentioned at the end that I would love to find a copy on vinyl to listen to. Well dear reader I managed to! It arrived today from the Netherlands with minimal fuss. It sounds great and I&rsquo;m not sure whether my review did it justice: that&rsquo;s the problem with attempting to (re-)review ten albums in ten days with Christmas and New Year all happening at the same time!</p></p>

        <p><p>The cats broke their new resolution not to knock stuff over in my office. Oh, who am I kidding? They never had such a resolution! If you can see a sheet of saturated paper, that was my to do list! Oh well.</p>

<p>The cats were either bounding across my desk to get to the window and look at the snow. Or they were just chasing each other around as usual.</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 7, 2024</p>
        <p><p>Dear Future Matt,</p>
<ol>
<li>Always look up instructions for what you want to do in the Git documentation. It&rsquo;s dry but it&rsquo;s good. In a pinch, look at Stack Overflow. Don&rsquo;t ask Chat-GPT for advice on Git problems!</li>
<li>To reverse mistakes, consult the <a href="https://ohshitgit.com">Oh Shit Git</a> website.</li>
<li>To make things easier, delete the remote to your Github repository and then add it (the remote) back again. This is so much easier than the alternative.</li>
</ol>
<p>Best wishes,
Past Matt (with his annual flash of January git confidence).</p></p>

<p>In 2023, it was Germany or go home.</p>
<p>Went to Cologne in January. Here is photographic evidence:</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/images/2023/cologne-proof.jpeg" alt="Photographic evidence of my visit to Cologne"></p>
<p>We took the Eurostar via Brussels. A bit of a long day on the way back but much less stressful compared to flying.</p>
<p>We went to the Isle of Wight in June. It was the first time I&rsquo;d been since I was about 8. This time I didn&rsquo;t get Chicken Pox. Anyway, here is photographic evidence:</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 1, 2024</p>
        <p><p>A quick list of ten other albums I considered to be among the best of last year. I either listened to these less, or in the cases of &ldquo;Transmission Three&rdquo; and &ldquo;Be Opened By The Wonderful&rdquo; considered them to be ineligible as they are compilations.</p>
<h3 id="yves-tumor-praise-a-lord-who-chews-but-which-does-not-consume-or-simply-hot-between-worlds">Yves Tumor, &ldquo;Praise a Lord Who Chews but Which Does Not Consume; (Or Simply, Hot Between Worlds)&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Great album, recommended to me by Apple Music slinging the first track into my discovery feed back when that featured was added. Lots of earworms and a really good headphone listen. My top 10 was pretty dance heavy and putting this in might have added a few more guitars. Highly recommended.</p></p>

<p>Sofia Kourtesis is a Berlin-based Peruvian dance producer, &ldquo;Madres&rdquo; is her debut album which follows on from a 2021 EP &ldquo;Fresia Magdalena&rdquo;. It was trailed by several singles, including the title track which caught my attention back in May. The album is dedicated to her parents and there are also songs dedicated to the surgeon who performed life-saving surgery on Kourtesis’s mother. The whole album is a heady mix of positivity and dedication to both music and to family.</p></p>

<p>&ldquo;Cool artwork! We haven&rsquo;t had a copy in but I can order it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Me picking it up a week later: &ldquo;Cool artwork!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imagine This is a High Dimensional Space of All Possibilities&rdquo; is definitely album title of the year, made all the more topical with the intrusion of Chat-GPT and the like into the cultural conversation. Large Language Models (LLMs) like Chat-GPT work by absorbing large amounts of textual data (i.e. this blog, helping to make all those instant album reviews you can write now just a tiny bit more shit) and breaking them down into tokens, with each token having a meaning and a grammatical role and so on. These meanings and roles form higher dimensional spaces in which the tokens are vectors, where the rules of the LLMs help determine which tokens live near to one another and which pairs are likely to sit together in &lsquo;meaningful&rsquo; sentences etc etc.</p></p>

<p>Some albums you come to one way: a good review on a blog you respect, a track appearing on a playlist by someone whose taste you trust, etc and so on. And sometimes you get directed to something multiple times. This is what happened to me this year with the irrepressible “When Will We Land?” by Barry Can’t Swim. Anyway, tracks by &ldquo;Barry&rdquo; appeared in mixes a lot this year and the album kept popping up in eagerly anticipated lists.</p></p>
