        <p>Feb. 4, 2022</p>
        <p><p><strong>Lifeforms</strong> is the 1994 album from the Future Sound of London. A double album (just), it also features the talents of Robert Fripp, Ozric Tentacles, Talvin Singh, Toni Halliday, and Liz Frazer. It reached number 6 on the UK album chart and went silver.</p>
<p>I have wanted to write about the <strong>Lifeforms</strong> album for a long time. In 2012, I even tried learning how to tell the tracks apart from one another. It was not a success. Ten years later, I know some of them but not all. I know all the music, of course, but the album as a whole resists my trainspotter-like urge to identify the margins and components of every track.</p></p>

        <p>Feb. 3, 2022</p>
        <p><p>At the moment I can’t compile this blog locally because my <code>ruby-ffi</code> install is somehow wrong and is preventing Jekyll from running on my recently upgraded Mac system. Fortunately the site still compiles on Netlify, or else you wouldn’t be reading this!</p>
<p>It’s always annoying when you rely on a complex multi-part system and some obscure part fails. It leaves you groping for answers and inventing unnecessary hack solutions. The dreaded old Stack Overflow rabbit hole. FFI stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_function_interface">Foreign Function Interface</a>, a mechanism that allows code written in one language to be called by another language.</p></p>

        <p><p>Hmmm it seems as though the <code>ffi</code> gem as installed by bundler is not compatible with a Mac that has an M1 chip. This limits my ability to preview blog posts locally. I might have to swap to a more modern static site generator (which is probably easier than working out what <code>ffi</code> actually does) - seems like a good February project!</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 1, 2022</p>
        <p><p>At the new year, thoughts and spare time for writing point me toward writing some new posts for my understated classics series. Expect some new ones soon.</p>
<p>I also reflected on my previous choices and thought a bit about how my music tastes have changed recently. Some of this has to do with streaming and the frustrations I wrote about <a href="https://mattischrome.com/a-pox-on-both-their-houses">in my last post</a>. Some of it is just down to getting older: I have less time to listen to new music, and much of the &rsquo;new&rsquo; stuff I listen to is me investigating the stuff I missed first time around. Who knew Art of Noise were so good? Not me, but I do now!</p></p>

        <p><p>How hard is it to just listen to music these days?</p>
<p>Spotify has crammed in all sorts of crap in to the app lately. Lyric videos, those weird interactive art things that are turned on by default, podcasts (so many podcasts), <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22798338/spotify-netflix-hub-exclusive-audio-extras">Netflix tie-ins</a>, and audiobooks. It wants to be the app that opens when you plug in your headphones (not that we’ll be doing that for much longer the way things are going). But I just want to listen to music!</p></p>

        <p><p>Today I listened to &lsquo;Cloudbusting&rsquo; by Kate Bush for the first time in a while. What a gloriously strange song it is. Best of all, it&rsquo;s one of those songs that obscures what it is really about. It&rsquo;s not a song about a change in the weather, but about <a href="https://wilhelmreichmuseum.org/about/biography-of-wilhelm-reich/">Wilhelm Reich</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orgone">orgone</a> accumulator, <a href="https://www.cultofweird.com/medical/radium-girls/">fluorescent yo-yos</a>, and a son (rather than a <em>sun</em>) coming out.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cloudbusting&rsquo; is from &lsquo;Hounds of Love&rsquo;, Kate&rsquo;s &lsquo;comeback&rsquo; album following the commercial failure of <a href="https://mattischrome.com/understated-classics-19">&lsquo;The Dreaming&rsquo;</a>, an album I wrote about in my <a href="https://mattischrome.com/tag/understated%20classics/">understated classics series</a>. It features four UK top 10 singles and some of her best work.</p></p>

        <p><p>I was due to have my second vaccination today, but like most people I rebooked to have it a bit earlier. No real side effects this time, save for a bit of malaise. Though that may have just been the thought of opening up the country when cases are still increasing quickly.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that I&rsquo;d urge everyone to get vaccinated and then to keep turning up for whatever boosters the people protecting us (e.g. JCVI, <em>not</em> the government) recommend in future. It seems like we aren&rsquo;t out of the woods yet, though the vaccination program appears to have had a decent impact on hospitalisation rates.</p></p>

        <p>Jul. 31, 2021</p>
        <p><p><em>Outline</em> is the first of a trilogy of novels by Rachel Cusk. In it, the narrator is travelling to Athens to help teach on a creative writing class. You could describe the rest of what happens in a couple of sentences. I won&rsquo;t be doing so because first, that&rsquo;s spoilers, and I don&rsquo;t do spoilers; second, <em>Outline</em> is one of those novels where what happens doesn&rsquo;t matter quite so much as how it all happens.</p></p>

        <p><p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but lately I&rsquo;ve been in need of some music that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Blots out the outside world</li>
<li>Helps me to concentrate on my work</li>
<li>Makes me feel a bit less anxious about the state of the world</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, allow me to submit the compilation Trance Nation for your consideration as an understated classic.</p>
<p>But Matt I&rsquo;ve heard trance music, I hear you say, and it&rsquo;s one of the least understated forms of music possible. Yes, dear reader, we <em>are</em> talking about that borderline obnoxious musical form with the thudding beats and the tinkly high synth lines. Indeed, it is a genre that has grown and eaten itself, and the rest of pop music along with it. The &ldquo;give it a drop or go home&rdquo; mentality that infects modern pop musics originates in Trance.</p></p>

        <p><p>I had my first Covid-19 vaccination on Friday. Leading up to it, I was borderline having a panic attack. From about lunchtime I was just all over the shop (the jab was at 7pm). I&rsquo;m glad that the vaccination centres run with such exactitude, but also with a sense of cheeriness. By the time I&rsquo;d had the jab, I was feeling much better just from the sheer relief of it.</p></p>

        <p><p>Ingrid has joined an online drawing class. She sits there on Teams getting feedback on her drawings, while I sit there attempting to absorb everything. I&rsquo;m also learning by doing, by making a line on the page. In some ways, it&rsquo;s instructive to observe the difference in what we learn with and without the feedback.</p>
<p>We bought some drawing materials and nice notepads. But to be honest, I still haven&rsquo;t made room in my day to draw regularly. This is a shame because you do have do these things regularly in order to develop the skill.</p></p>
