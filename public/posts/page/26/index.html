        <p>May. 29, 2013</p>
        <p><p>Today I went to see &ldquo;George Bellows 1882-1925 Modern American Life&rdquo; <a href="http://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibitions/george-bellows/">at the Royal Academy of Arts</a>. It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve been to the RA but I was emboldened by my art pass and the fact that Bellows was a contemporary of Edward Hopper, a painter whom I admire greatly. This is the first major retrospective of Bellows&rsquo; work in the UK and taking in his wonderful paintings this afternoon, I felt a little embarrassed that I hadn&rsquo;t seen anything of his before.</p></p>

        <p>May. 25, 2013</p>
        <p><p>Yesterday I went to see the Saloua Raouda Choucair show at the Tate Modern. As it was quite small, I went to see <a href="/lichtenstein-at-tate-modern/">the Lichtenstein show</a> again as well.</p>
<p>Choucair is an underrated Lebanese artist and many of the paintings and sculptures shown were created in the fifties and sixties. Her sculptures in particular are amazing.</p>
<p>The first room is lined with paintings that were nearly all gouache on paper, about 40cm by 30cm. These paintings were vibrant and abstract. I prefer larger oil paintings and it took me a while to get to grips with the small format and the bright colours, but they are really quite wonderful: the colours swim and dance in front of you. I thought the nudes were particularly interesting, mainly because nudes are executed by almost every artist at some stage (there are some rather spotty ones by Lichtenstein for example) and are usually quite memorable &ndash; so seeing an artist&rsquo;s nudes can give you a point of relation to other artists. Choucair&rsquo;s nudes are pink and ample and altogether the more charming for it.</p></p>

        <p>May. 23, 2013</p>
        <p><p>It was quite hard to choose an 808 State album for the <a href="understated-classics">understated classics series</a> for two reasons. The first is that I was introduced to 808 State quite late through a friend&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s cassette copy of The Shamen&rsquo;s En-Tact (the original version recorded from vinyl that had a thirteen minute version of &ldquo;Evil Is Eden&rdquo;) that also had &ndash; to fill out the C90 &ndash; the full length sweary version of &ldquo;What Time Is Love?&rdquo; by The KLF and four tracks: &ldquo;Cubik&rdquo;, &ldquo;Pacific&rdquo;, &ldquo;Olympic&rdquo; (I think&hellip;), and &ldquo;In Yer Face&rdquo;.</p></p>

        <p>May. 21, 2013</p>
        <p><p>This was a show that I had put off going to see for quite a while now. Looking online at the pictures featured in the show did not really excite me enough to get out and see it. I&rsquo;d seen <em>Whaam!</em> before in isolation (it&rsquo;s part of the Tate collection and will no doubt return once the retrospective show is over) and it didn&rsquo;t really grab me, arresting as it is. However, with plenty of free time this week it was an ideal time to go see it and I was happy to be proved wrong.</p></p>

        <p>May. 20, 2013</p>
        <p><p>&ldquo;The Marriage Plot&rdquo; by Jeffrey Eugenides is a novel about love and growing up set in the privileged world of US academia in the early eighties. The main plot concerns a love triangle involving two guys and a girl. Madeline Hanna, the girl at the apex of the love triangle, is the main focus of the novel and the majority of the novel is told from her standpoint. I think her sections are incredibly well written but I&rsquo;d love the thoughts of a female reader, in case it is actually all a horribly male way of seeing through a young woman&rsquo;s eyes. In love with Madeline (and the guy that we meet first) is Mitchell Grammaticus, an overly deep guy who is terribly concerned about whether he is doing the right thing in the world. He thinks that religious studies is for him but later finds that it is harder to live up to your ideals than you first imagine.</p></p>

        <p>May. 17, 2013</p>
        <p><p>I saw <em>Star Trek: Into Darkness</em> last night in 3D at the IMAX in Waterloo. I am going to have to separate this into a review into two parts, a review of the film and a review of the viewing experience. I am not completely happy with how the film experience is changed by the 3D and the super big screen and I will try to explain what I mean.</p></p>

<p>How you view <em>The Terror</em> pretty much depends on how much you have kept up with The Flips output since their last official album, the clanking double behemoth in Merkin packaging that was <em>Embryonic</em>. The irony being that I used <em>Embryonic</em> to deal with a break-up and <em>The Terror</em> is pretty much about&hellip; a break-up.</p></p>

        <p><p>Just the David Bowie album this month as it’s pretty much the only new music that I’ve listened to.</p>
<p>I must admit that I had no idea what to expect of “The Next Day”. It comes almost exactly ten years after “Reality”, an album that I have never really got into despite it having some pretty decent fun tracks like “New Killer Star” and a nice cover of “Pablo Picasso” that has never sent me in search of Jonathan Richman’s original.</p></p>

        <p>Mar. 18, 2013</p>
        <p><p>A while back, I decided I was going to write about the Iain M. Banks sci-fi-novels (mainly as a respite from having to read and write about <a href="j-g-ballard">J. G. Ballard novels</a>, but I only got as fas as writing about the excellent “Against A Dark Barkground” and re-reading the first of the Culture novels “Consider Phlebas”. WARNING: Some plot spoilers follow (but not too many).</p>
<p>I’m not sure why it has taken almost two years to write about this novel. Perhaps it is because I couldn’t find myself a proper explanation for the title. The following is my own theory, feel free to add your own in the comments. The book takes its name from the epigraph, an extract from T.S. Elliot’s <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/201/1.html">“The Waste Land”</a> (which is also on my “to read” list):</p></p>

        <p>Mar. 13, 2013</p>
        <p><p>“Walking With Thee” is the second album by Liverpool band <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinic_(band)">Clinic</a>. It was released in 2002, which seems like an age ago now. Even longer ago they released the single “The Return of Evil Bill”, which was got me interested in them in the first place.</p>
<p>I recently got back into “Walking With Thee” when I picked “Vulture” in my A-Z of Animals playlist last month. I’d forgotten just how great a song it is, both musically and lyrically. It’s a caution against letting those with more power and wealth lord it over us – viz, “the best that you’ve left here for others / is the best the rest of us know” – and so it’s surely much more a song for these times than back then in 2002. Anyway, I’m going to avoid too much reading into the lyrics for this particular understated classic, as most of the time Clinic are defiantly resistant to that kind of analysis.</p></p>

        <p><p>I have had a lot of ideas for posts swirling around in my head in recent days. This is because I have actually done quite a lot of cool things in that time, and because I have hung out with some great people who make me think, and because I always have a whole load of things bouncing around in there anyway - space junk of the mind. I was thinking about how to put together these thoughts I have been having about art and about stories and yes, about love too. It all kind of got muddled up and then I saw it.</p></p>
