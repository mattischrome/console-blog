        <p>Apr. 30, 2012</p>
        <p><p>A mostly instrumental month with a comeback from Orbital, an excellent remix collection from Battles, an amazing movie documenting a live performance by the Chemical Brothers and Austin Wintory’s soundtrack to the game <em>Journey</em>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Orbital <em>Wonky</em></li>
<li>Battles <em>Dross Glop</em></li>
<li>The Chemical Brothers <em>Don’t Think</em></li>
<li>Austin Wintory <em>Journey (Original Soundtrack)</em></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="orbital-_wonky_">Orbital <em>Wonky</em></h2>
<p>I am quite keen on Orbital, though perhaps not as keen as I am on the similarly named Orb. I think I have got all the Orbital albums, mostly bought on eBay after the fact. (Funny story though, I did find a copy of <em>In Sides</em> in the loft of a house where I lived in Bath, along with several other albums…) My favourite Orbital album is probably <em>Snivilisation</em> but they all have their moments, whether it is the genuine sliver of emotion shot through <em>Halcyon</em> off the brown album, the proggy long-form tracks on <em>In Sides</em> like <em>The Girl With The Sun In Her Head</em> or <em>Out There Somewhere</em> (parts one and two), or indeed the arsing about with heavy metal samples on tracks like <em>Tension</em> off the highly underrated <em>The Altogether</em>.</p></p>

<p>A hefty reading list that should keep me occupied into the summer. A friend on facebook asked “What course is that for?”, to which I replied “It’s for one of the modules I am doing at the university of life.” This response was quite popular.</p></p>

        <p><blockquote>
<p>Sit back and let it happen, / Let us take your time away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Nearly God</em> is Tricky’s second album, which was released under a different name either because Island rejected it as the follow-up to <em>Maxinequaye</em> or because it came too quickly after and Tricky just wanted it released. I had this album before <em>Maxinequaye</em> because back then it wasn’t as easy to go back and catch up with albums that you had missed as it is now. I had bought enough singles to get the postcards through the post that advertised <em>Nearly God</em> (this, kids, is what we had before e-mail and liking things on Facebook) and when I heard <em>Poems</em> for the first time on the radio I was incredibly excited.</p></p>

        <p>Apr. 9, 2012</p>
        <p><p><em>The Lonely Londoners</em> by Sam Selvon was written in 1956 and tells of the experiences of West Indian men moving to London for work. It has been described as the definitive novel about the experiences of the <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/museum/item.asp?item_id=50">Windrush settlers</a>. The narrative centres on a man named Moses who was one of the first to come to London and finds himself the first port of call for many subsequent immigrants:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It look to old Moses that he hardly have time to settle in the old Brit’n before all sorts of fellars start coming straight to his room in the Water when they land up in London from the West Indies, saying that so and so tell them that Moses is a good fellar to contact, that he would help them get place to stay and work to do.</p></p>

        <p>Apr. 3, 2012</p>
        <p><p>I pay to have this blog up and running. That is, I pay for the space where it is stored and I pay for the name. I have to look after all the files and plug-ins, I have to perform all the updates and optimise the database tables. All this is great fun but wouldn’t it be cheaper to slap the mattischro.me address onto a hosted WordPress.com account?</p>
<p>Well, yes it would. I suppose I just like the independence of having my own little patch of cyberspace, sitting there waiting for all you dear readers to come and visit. Nice ideas don’t make the world go round though and so I need a better reason than that.</p></p>

        <p>Mar. 31, 2012</p>
        <p><p>Five albums for Album Digest March 2012</p>
<ol>
<li>Fanfarlo <em>Rooms Filled With Light</em></li>
<li>The Shins <em>Port Of Morrow</em></li>
<li>Grails <em>Deep Politics</em></li>
<li>New Build <em>Yesterday Was Lived And Lost</em></li>
<li>Scuba <em>Personality</em></li>
</ol>
<p>A nice collection of albums this month - things usually pick up in March after a slow period after Christmas. One of these is a “catch-up” (the album by Grails) but apart from that one, everything else was released in the last five weeks or so… I should probably have included the album by Racehorses that I bought on my birthday but I will have to leave that for next month as I haven’t listened to it that much. In fact, it is still in my housemate’s car!</p></p>

<p>I have written about a <a href="uc4">fair</a> <a href="uc6">number of</a> <a href="uc13">ambient</a> albums in this series (and there are at least two more to come!) but perhaps none are as unobtrusive as this one by Howard Budd and Brian Eno. It’s a subtle collection of music that sits at the margins of your consciousness: for a long time it was the music that I turned to when I could not sleep but I could just as easily imagine it as (ahem!) romantic background music as I could something to work to. I actually bought it in 2006 to listen to on an overnight flight back from the US.</p></p>

<p><a href="album-digest-february-2011">Last February</a> was a pretty good month for song based albums, although the likes of Radiohead and James Blake provided plenty of electronic noodling in and around their song structures. (Interestingly, out of the two out-and-out song based albums, one was one of the worst albums of the year and the other one of the best).</p></p>

        <p>Feb. 9, 2012</p>
        <p><p><a href="j-g-ballard">Ages ago</a> I set out to write a post for each of JG Ballard’s novels. In fact it is the oldest post on this blog. Most of the novels (I don’t have the two autobiographical novels <em>Empire Of The Sun</em> or <em>The Kindness Of Women</em> and the late period novel <em>Milennium People</em>) are sat in a row on top of my broken bookshelf, part of the weight there that bowed outer frame of the unit and made the inner shelves collapse. Had I known that it would be a task unfinished nearly eighteen months later and destroy a piece a furniture that I did not yet own, I may have been less ambitious.</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 31, 2012</p>
        <p><p>Five albums to see in the new year:</p>
<ol>
<li>FOE “Bad Dream Hotline”</li>
<li>Leila “U &amp; I”</li>
<li>Diagrams “Black Light”</li>
<li>Pyramids &amp; Horseback “A Throne Without A King”</li>
<li>FabricLive 61 mixed by Pinch</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="foe-_bad-dream-hotline_">FOE <em>Bad Dream Hotline</em></h2>
<p>I listened to “Bad Dream Hotline” about four times thinking “who does her voice remind me of?”. In the end I realised it was Sophie Ellis-Bextor, though in parts she sounds like KT Tunstall too. Of course these are rather tame references and I don’t mean to damn with faint praise, this album is much more edgy than those two ever were. If you are after some girly power pop with a darker edge then this will no doubt be the album that you have been waiting for.</p></p>

        <h1><a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/understated-classics-15/" title="Understated Classics #15: Début by Björk">Understated Classics #15: Début by Björk</a></h1>
        <p>Jan. 23, 2012</p>
        <p><p>I got into Début via a cassette from the library, much like I did with <a href="uc1"><em>Together Alone</em> by Crowded House</a>. I suppose it is less obscure than many of my choices for <a href="understated-classics">this strand</a> but I do think that <em>Post</em> is more well-known (because of <em>It’s Oh So Quiet</em>, which we shall mention here only briefly) and that <em>Homogenic</em> is probably more popular among her fans.</p>
<p>What I really like about <em>Début</em> though, as much as the album itself, is the panoply of remixes and alternative versions that surround the release. In this way <em>Post</em> is at least as strong if not stronger and you might recall that I had similar fun <a href="uc13">when writing about the Orb’s album U.F.Orb a while back</a>. As a result of this, there will be some detours into the remixes and live versions when discussing this album. In particular, I will mention the remix collection <em>the best mixes from the album début for all the people who don’t buy white labels</em> and the recording of an MTV Unplugged show that is available in the <em>Live Box</em> box set.</p></p>
