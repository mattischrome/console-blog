        <p>Nov. 7, 2011</p>
        <p><blockquote>
<p>I think it’s time to discuss your philosophy of drug use as it relates to artistic endeavour…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That quote is from the movie “The Naked Lunch” directed by David Cronenburg (see also <a href="/crash/">this</a>) and it also opens “Bug Powder Dust” by Bomb The Bass, the five star single that opens “Clear”. A rollicking piece of rock rap dripping with pop culture references that runs for four and half minutes and does not stop until another quote from “The Naked Lunch”, it is probably one of my favourite songs of the 90s. That churning guitar line sends me right back.</p></p>

        <p>Nov. 3, 2011</p>
        <p><p>There was much excitement about <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1598778/">Contagion</a> at work. Finally a movie that explains  as part of the plot! A bunch of us went to see it, mainly to see whether <a href="http://contagionmovie.warnerbros.com/index.html">a disaster movie about a global pandemic</a> could hold up as entertainment and to have a bit of a giggle if it couldn’t.</p>
<p>I liked three things in particular about the film. I liked the cinematography, especially the opening sequences with the index cases staggering around. I liked the soundtrack except for when it intruded a bit too much into proceedings. Finally, I liked Marion Cotillard, who seems to be in every interesting movie at the moment.</p></p>

        <p>Nov. 2, 2011</p>
        <p><p>I saw that a friend had ‘liked’ this book on Facebook and reading about it on <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Philosopher-Wolf-Lessons-Death-Happiness/dp/1847081029/">amazon</a>, I was curious enough to give it a go. It is the autobiography of the philosopher <a href="http://rowlands.philospot.com/">Mark Rowlands</a>, specifically the experiences and lessons learned from raising a wolf, Brenin, from cub to maturity and beyond.</p>
<p>The book addresses different aspects of philosophy including the nature of evil and the interaction between humans and other animals. As you might expect, the book pays particular attention to our interactions with wolves and dogs. There is also a lot of explanation of the difference between wolves and dogs. Rowlands appears often to disparage dogs, though remembering my experiences of our Labradors while growing up did make me nod in agreement quite often.</p></p>

        <p>Oct. 31, 2011</p>
        <p><p>This month we have albums by Björk, Coldplay, M83, and Radiohead.</p>
<h2 id="album-digest-october-2011---intro">Album Digest October 2011 - Intro</h2>
<p>I listened to Wilco’s <em>The Whole Love</em> again the other day. I happened to be walking past the venue in Portsmouth where I went to see them live back in 2004 and it seemed the right fit. I really enjoyed the album after a period of not having listened to it and I found that being familiar with the songs allowed me to better appreciate the production of the album. It really is better than I had said last time when I included it in the <a href="/2011/09/album-digest-september-2011/">September Album Digest</a>, I suppose that it was the danger in writing about music you have only had with you for a few weeks (or days in the case of <em>The Whole Love</em>).</p></p>

        <p>Sep. 30, 2011</p>
        <p><p>Hmmm, a rather grey looking selection of covers this month. The albums I have listened to most are:</p>
<ol>
<li>John Beltran <em>Ambient Selections</em></li>
<li>FabricLive 59 mixed by Four Tet</li>
<li>The Rapture <em>In The Grace Of Your Love</em></li>
<li>Wilco <em>The Whole Love</em></li>
</ol>
<p>I have actually only had the Wilco album since Monday of this week (the 26th) but it has inveigled its way into my consciousness quite quickly. As I have said before, <a href="/2010/playlist-1-metallic/">this blog owes its name to a Wilco song</a> and they are quite an important band to me. The other albums are mostly electronic, although The Rapture are distinctly indie flavoured as they hit the dance floor.</p></p>

        <p>Sep. 9, 2011</p>
        <p><p><strong>FUN FACT:</strong> It was because of the artwork to this album that I obsessively scrawled onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome on my pencil case at school. I also had a very passable u.f.orb logo drawn on it too.</p>
<h2 id="in-the-blue-room">In The Blue Room</h2>
<p>I had my first “close encounter” with The Orb in 1992 when the single <em>Blue Room</em> was in the charts. Back then, as I <a href="uc2">mentioned previously</a>, I would listen to the radio a lot and this tune - introduced as the longest single ever to enter the UK chart - struck me as really interesting. The radio edit was a burbling wash of synths and female vocals underpinned by a hefty bass performance from <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/music/2008/06/wobble-life-music-dub-leaving">Jah Wobble</a>. Incidentally, the same week that <em>Blue Room</em> entered the chart, I was actually listening out for <em>Sentinel</em> by Mike Oldfield and this single (<a href="uc10">from Tubular Bells II</a>) featured two remixes by The Orb.</p></p>

        <p>Sep. 9, 2011</p>
        <p><p>A week or so ago, I finished reading <em>Dune</em> by Frank Herbert. It tells the story of a revolution within a Galactic Empire that takes place on a harsh and unforgiving desert planet called Arrakis. One central theme is how destinies can be shaped despite being intertwined around many axes. Another is the importance of adaptation in the fight for survival.</p>
<p>I came to <em>Dune</em> via the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087182/">David Lynch film</a> and then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert%27s_Dune">the Sci-Fi Channel’s mini-series</a>, which I was able to <a href="http://www.lovefilm.com/film/Dune-Part-1/161663/">stream through LoveFilm</a>. Of the two filmed versions, I found the latter to be more enjoyable and this is almost certainly because it runs to nearly six hours. The 1984 film runs to over 3 hours and yet still feels rather rushed. The Lynch version is to be praised though as in my opinion it develops a unique aesthetic for the Dune universe that I did not detect so much in the book.</p></p>

        <p>Aug. 31, 2011</p>
        <p><p>I bought a collection of electronic music this month. I mixed them all up in a smart playlist on iTunes, the smart aspect being to limit to tracks that had been played fewer than five then six then seven times etc. This made sure I was still listening to all the tracks equally often, despite the randomness.</p>
<ol>
<li>Biosphere <em>N-plants</em></li>
<li>Ford &amp; Lopatin <em>Channel Pressure</em></li>
<li>Gus Gus <em>Arabian Horse</em></li>
<li>Instra:Mental <em>Resolution 653</em></li>
<li>Jon Tejada <em>Parabolas</em></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="biosphere-_n-plants_">Biosphere <em>N-Plants</em></h2>
<p>I think this album makes Biosphere the most reviewed musician on this blog at the moment but I don’t mind too much, he makes some great stuff. <em>N-Plants</em> is a series of pieces about Japanese nuclear power plants and was ready for release by about February this year, just before the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster">Fukishima nuclear disaster</a> in March. It ended up being released in June. I am not sure if this represents a delay or not but as this quote shows, <a href="http://www.touchmusic.org.uk/catalogue/to84_biosphere_nplants.html">Geir Jenssen is aware of how spooky the timing was</a>.</p></p>

<p>No matter how intellectual one gets about these things, the primary function of music is to have fun. With this in mind it is a good time to turn to Roxette then, as they are almost always the epitome of fun.</p>
<p>I received <em>Look Sharp!</em> as a present for my ninth birthday. This was probably a bit young to fully understand all the emotions expressed on the record. It’s just as well that it is also crammed with the kind of pop confections that made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Bore_Us,_Get_to_the_Chorus!">“Don’t bore us, get to the chorus!”</a> something of a band motto and made for a great introduction to the world of pop for a nine year old boy.</p></p>

        <h1><a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/five-lessons-from-a-year-of-blogging/" title="Five lessons from a year of blogging">Five lessons from a year of blogging</a></h1>
        <p>Aug. 5, 2011</p>
        <p><p>I have now been writing decent length articles on this site for about a year. I have learned a lot in this time, mostly about writing but also how to express your feelings and how to marshal your ideas and passions into action. For this month’s “five on the fifth”, I would like to share  with you some of the things I have learned.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Writing posts consistently is hard…</strong> There are a lot of things that get in the way of regular posting. Sometimes it is ambition undermines me, I have ideas for posts that are easy to think up that turn out to be much harder to actually write. Other times life does just get in the way, it is  a time-consuming activity to write five hundred or more words every day. I like to write posts out longhand before typing them up. I often find mistakes or horrible phrasing when I do this and often what seemed like a simple matter of typing something up becomes a bit of a mission. Of course, there are times when I am just lazy or uninspired.</li>
<li><strong>…except when it is easy.</strong> I discovered early on that having a few arcs through the posts was a good idea as it makes you think a few in advance about what to do next. I prefer to be a generalist but it is nice to have the movie reviews, the <a href="understated-classics">understated classics</a> and the <a href="j-g-ballard">JG Ballard</a> novels to fall back on. Truth be told I am a little bored of Ballard now but even if I retire that particular strand of posts (Spoiler: Don’t worry, <em>High-Rise</em> is on the way soon) I can always resume it later. Meanwhile, I can pad out the off days with some quotes or some photos.</li>
<li><strong>Easier to read is easier to write.</strong> I hope that the blog is easier to read now than when I started. I still find myself producing the odd clunky phrase now and then but the number of passive sentences is decreasing. The unexpected benefit of this has been that I find it easier to check earlier posts in search for inspiration about what to write next. Early on, I would often end up editing old posts into something more comprehensible instead of writing new material. The “After the Deadline” feature of <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jetpack/">Jetpack for WordPress</a> has been very helpful in training me to write better.</li>
<li><strong>WordPress is a lot of fun.</strong> The statistic is that <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> now powers about 500 million websites. It is not hard to see why, it is easy to install, easy to customise to suit to your tastes and most of all, it rewards you for continuing to produce content. I have installed all sorts of plug-ins, including a <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-word-count/">word count plug-in</a> that tells me that I have (up to this post) written a total of 89,032 published words. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_of_a_novel">If Wikipedia is to be believed</a>, that is about the length of a pretty long novel. At least now I know I could write a novel in a year even if it was a rather surreal one featuring a 10K run, spiders and an Apatosaurus.</li>
<li><strong>I still have a lot more to do, a lot more to learn.</strong></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2017-update">2017 Update</h3>
<p>Adding to this footnote some years later (2017) I realise that not all blog posts are permanent. Sometimes you write what you need to at the time and then take it down later. We don&rsquo;t have to be permanently changed by what we once wrote on a Wednesday afternoon.</p></p>

<p>This month’s collection of albums is a rather mellow bunch. The SBTRKT album (self-titled) is probably the most frenetic of the five though even that does not exactly pound four to the floor. Most of it is pretty calm, though  the occasional burst of pop to spice things up: sometimes it is as downtempo as the rest (<em>Right Thing To Do</em> and <em>Trials Of The Past</em>) but at other times things spark into life, as on <em>Pharaohs</em>.</p></p>

<p>“I read the news today, oh boy”  (The Beatles, <em>A Day In The Life</em>.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sometimes watching the news feels like a series of repeated blows to the face: arbitrary, cruel and unrelenting. It gets draining and upsetting, and leaves you fearful of what might come next.</p>
<p>You won’t need me to tell you about the tragedies that have occurred all over the world in the last few days: drought in East Africa, the gunman running amok in Norway, the death of Amy Winehouse and the horrific train crash in China.</p></p>
