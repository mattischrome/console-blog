        <p><h3 id="does-science-fiction-have-to-be-believable-to-be-meaningful">Does Science Fiction have to be believable to be meaningful?</h3>
<p>Should science fiction have predictive power? In plotting the vast unknowns of the future, should authors aim for prescience? Will people be able to say of the best SF novels in five hundred years time that some novels were right about some things and that these novels are better than the ones that didn’t?</p>
<p>I would say no, otherwise we would be remarkably unfair on an awful lot of good writing. That said, I doubt that SF is read for the futurology. As with all literature, SF is at it is best when it has something to say about the world around us now, no matter when it may be set. And if SF has any kind of predictive record, it does better when the psychological issues arising from continued technological development are considered over the mere technology of that advancement. In the long run, a fictional account of space dog Laika (does one exist?) that rings true emotionally will probably endure longer than a pulp novel entitled “Dogs In Space!” (though that is a great title!).</p></p>

        <p>Aug. 12, 2010</p>
        <p><h2 id="i-discovered-the-aloof-while-listening-to-the-top-40">I discovered The Aloof while listening to the Top 40</h2>
<p>When I was younger, I used to listen to the Top 40 every Sunday. To begin with, this was partly an endurance thing and partly an obsession with one day seeing Roxette top the charts - alas, they never did, though for one thrilling spring “Joyride” did flirt with the upper reaches of the chart.</p>
<p>Listening to the charts is probably the best way to become a lover of music. Nearly all my musical loves stem from listening to the top 40 chart, either directly from crouching next to my static-y radio on Sunday evening, or as something that evolving beyond those initial tastes later on. I soon realised that listening to music at the lower end of the chart was more rewarding and not just because this was where all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Your_Heart">the later Roxette singles ended up</a>. It was where all the oddities washed in, sometimes there one week and never to be heard again - sometimes growing up into something big. I remember first hearing <a href="http://www.prideofmanchester.com/music/ucc.htm">“The Key The Secret” by the Urban Cookie Collective</a> entering the chart at number 40, it eventually climbed to number 2. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/content/articles/2004/11/20/entertainment_music_local_bands_kws_feature.shtml">Also “Please Don’t Go” by KWS which crept all the way up to number 1</a> - these were great dance records that grew by word of mouth at a time when great dance records were weird and new and meant something.</p></p>

        <p>Aug. 3, 2010</p>
        <p><p>This week Arcade Fire released their hotly anticipated third album &ldquo;The Suburbs&rdquo;.  I loved &ldquo;Neon Bible&rdquo; but critics found it preachy, as overbearing as the religious folk it sought to satirise. I disagree and think it was an impressive continuation from an exciting debut. &ldquo;The Suburbs&rdquo; steps on from their previous two albums, both in subject matter and tone. It&rsquo;s sad, thoughtful, resigned, angry and tetchy - among other things. “The Suburbs” isn&rsquo;t the understated classic that I want to discuss though: with all the praise and plaudits, it may never suit this new thread of posts. I want to write about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Together_Alone">Together Alone by Crowded House</a>.</p></p>

        <p>Aug. 2, 2010</p>
        <p><p>Reading &ldquo;Crash&rdquo; at 17 left me in a state of numb shock. It got me hooked and left me with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._G._Ballard">J. G. Ballard</a> as one of my favourite authors. I then devoured a short story collection called &ldquo;Myths of the Near Future&rdquo; around the same time. You may recognise it because the Klaxons appropriated the title for their debut album. Those stories captured my imagination, in particular the eponymous story of a world gone to run amid &ldquo;space sickness&rdquo;.</p></p>
