    <div><p>It&rsquo;s difficult to write honestly about your feelings. It&rsquo;s difficult to write about your feelings consistently, for a living on a regular basis. It&rsquo;s difficult to write about your feelings when the world constantly intrudes with inanity, insanity and hatred. It&rsquo;s difficult to write under those conditions without seeming frayed, without coming loose at the edges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get To Heaven&rdquo;, the third album by <a href="http://www.everything-everything.co.uk">Everything Everything</a>, was forged under these stresses and pressures. For most of its running time it sounds like either a bomb ticking down to explode or like a clock inexorably counting up missed opportunities and stolen moments. It sounds for all the world as though it is trapped between fight and flight, paused between action and apathy. Yet it also subjects the listener to the yammerings of a culture that has driven itself mad. Depth and surface, glass and steel, truth and lies.</p></div>

It stars <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001618/">Joaquin Phoenix</a> as Larry &lsquo;Doc&rsquo; Sportello who&rsquo;s put on to a case of possible kidnapping by his &ldquo;ex-old lady&rdquo; Shasta, played by <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/16/katherine-waterston-jk-rowlings-fantastic-beasts-harry-potter">Katherine Waterston</a>.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no point attempting to tell much more you of the plot of Inherent Vice: it&rsquo;s rather convoluted and self-digesting. At least this means there&rsquo;s very little chance of stumbling into inadvertent spoilers. However, most of the plot strands do fall into place by the end, much more than I&rsquo;d imagined they would half way through.</p></div>

    <div><p>This little masterpiece was released in 1991. I got my copy on cassette for Christmas that year, but by May in 1992 they&rsquo;d already &ldquo;retired&rdquo; and split up.</p>
<p>The KLF were a band in the right place at the right time with the right idea. Taking advantage of synthesizers and the idea of fusing rock and pop music with the emerging sound of house music, they laid the ground for many of the most successful electronic acts that followed them. They were also master showmen, taking a whole host of crazy conspiracy theories and smooshing them together in one stadium-sized package.</p></div>

Empirical evidence seems to bear this out: all those people who get to work before you do, super-eager to get everything done. But then all the people walking under your windows late at night, drunk and laughing, they sound like they&rsquo;re having a whale of a time too.</p>
<p>I oscillate between the two extremes, though I tend to sleep better if I stay up late. My natural sleep hours are 1am to 8am, though I am usually human if I can get up just after 7. Whenever I try to stick to getting up early, to do masochistic things like running or being organised, I often find it harder to get to sleep or I wake up at 3 rather than 6. I end up second guessing my alarm clock.</p></div>

<p>It&rsquo;s very funny. Right from the opening credits you get the minions and their anarchic fun-loving slapstick humour. There&rsquo;s always been something delightful about they way in which they innocently bumble around. Their penchant for evil bosses is inexplicable but incredibly amusing.</p></div>

    <div><p>To reboot this series, Album Digest June 2015 features five fantastic albums from Hot Chip, Jamie xx, Blanck Mass, Holly Herndon, and The Orb. I could pick loads more as I&rsquo;ve listened to a lot of albums since <a href="/album-digest-february-2015/">February</a> but I decided to focus on the more electronic material. This means that I have no excuses for not continuing next month with a rockier theme.</p>
<h2 id="hot-chip-why-make-sense">Hot Chip &ldquo;Why Make Sense?&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Hot Chip seem to be settling in to a pattern with their album releases, alternating between messy experimental affairs and then a state of the art correction. Witness how &ldquo;The Warning&rdquo; smartened up the all-over-the-place &ldquo;Coming On Strong&rdquo; and how &ldquo;One Life Stand&rdquo; moulded and matured the lovestruck meandering of &ldquo;Made In The Dark&rdquo; into a lithe ten song set. &ldquo;Why Make Sense?&rdquo; takes the earnest song-based approach of &ldquo;In Our Heads&rdquo; and casts it into a funky fun-filled fifty minutes. It&rsquo;s as concise as they&rsquo;ve been since &ldquo;One Life Stand&rdquo;.</p></div>

<p>So why does Facebook feel the need to jiggle things about into a random order? Well most of you have that mobile phone app of theirs that sucks your battery and your data allowance like crazy (mainly by auto-playing videos like a dick). They know you’re checking your Facebook on the loo at work and that that limits your interaction time. During this precious interlude they want you to see the stuff that they think interests you and the things that other people paid for you to see. You’re going to see some hick’s new tattoo, at least one photo of someone else’s child and an advert telling you to vote Conservative - whether you like it or not.</p></div>

The site aims to help people who know at least one programming language to learn others by proving a quick run through of the main language features. It&rsquo;s not quite enough to get you up and running. After all, having sample code doesn&rsquo;t get you the compiler. However, it&rsquo;s a nice start that shows you how similar (and different) language X is compared to the one(s) you already know.</p></div>

    <div><p>Let&rsquo;s assume that Jim has just had a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_United_Kingdom_bank_rescue_package">sudden unexpected expenditure</a>: a neighbour released a bull into his back garden and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/nov/01/creditcrunch.subprimecrisis">it destroyed his conservatory</a>. Let&rsquo;s assume that the conservatory is essential to Jim&rsquo;s wellbeing, so it has to be fixed immediately. As a result Jim&rsquo;s debts, which <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/03/senior-tory-financial-crash-was-purely-a-banking-crisis-not-labour-overspend">were previously small and well-managed</a>, have now increased somewhat.</p>
<p>Obviously Jim can&rsquo;t keep that debt hanging over him forever. What does he do?</p>
<p>Fortunately for Jim, the circumstances of his borrowing aren&rsquo;t so different before and after the event. <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/interest-rates/9922941/Interest-rates-predictions-Four-more-years-of-0.5.html">Interest rates are low and are predicted to stay low</a>, and the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21554311">terms of his credit haven&rsquo;t changed a great deal despite his increased borrowing</a>.</p></div>

    <div><p>There&rsquo;s a reason I cannot and will not vote Conservative, and like most people&rsquo;s apparent motive for voting tory it is also a selfish one. As someone employed in the public sector, working to ensure the greater good, I&rsquo;m a member of an increasingly endangered species.</p>
<p>Ah Matthew, I hear you say, you&rsquo;re trotting out the old &ldquo;the turkeys have voted for Christmas&rdquo; line. Well no, like I said, this is purely selfish. When you mark that X in the box, you tend to think about yourself only. Never mind the turkeys (for now).</p></div>
