    <div><p>I thought I&rsquo;d add three of my favourite David Bowie albums to my review of Blackstar to a form an album digest tribute. Also among my favourites but not included here is &ldquo;Outside&rdquo;, which will be included in the understated classics (currently it&rsquo;s number 66) at some point. I thought about bumping &ldquo;Outside&rdquo; up the running order but I&rsquo;d like to be objective about it when its turn comes.</p>
<h3 id="station-to-station">Station To Station</h3>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the side effects of the cocaine / I&rsquo;m thinking it must be love&rdquo; sings Bowie on the title track of his tenth studio album &ldquo;Station To Station&rdquo;, released in 1976. But this album is most definitely almost entirely built on cocaine, from the weird Kabbalah channeling title track, to the smooth funk of &ldquo;Golden Years&rdquo; and on toward to the weepy conclusion of his cover of &ldquo;Wild Is The Wind&rdquo;.</p></div>

    <div><p>For Ingrid&rsquo;s birthday, we went to see <a href="http://moscowcityballet.com/en/repertoire/ballet/1">The Nutcracker performed by the Moscow City Ballet</a> at <a href="http://kingsportsmouth.co.uk">The King&rsquo;s Theatre in Southsea</a>.</p>
<p>The original conversation went something along the lines of &ldquo;Matt, please come and see some ballet with me on my birthday! It might not be your thing but I&rsquo;d love someone to come and see it with me&rdquo;. As I&rsquo;ve always loved a bit of Tchaikovsky, I said yes.</p>
<p>My only previous encounter with a ballet was an adaptation of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_II_(ballet)">Christopher Marlowe&rsquo;s Edward II by John McCabe</a> during my English Literature A-level. We got a day trip to exotic Bristol out of it, which when I was 17 meant the chance to visit all the cool record shops looking for rare KLF vinyl that I couldn&rsquo;t afford. We also got underage hammered at the pub before going to the Hippodrome to watch a ballet in which a man flounced around with a giant pink strap-on on (as if male ballet dancers didn&rsquo;t have enough of that action going on already!). Needless to say, it did little to convert me.</p></div>

<p>It is hard to write short posts to a timetable, let alone churn out long posts on a regular basis. As a result, this longer post is not likely to become the norm. It&rsquo;s an idea I had that bloomed into something ever bigger and this time I decided to have a crack at it.</p></div>

I wrote about this album in my understated classics series and I want to share some thoughts on the reissue. I love this album so I was excited to hear the remaster and the additional material.</p>
<p>I can’t comment on the physical version of the release as I can’t afford it at the moment. I also had to wait to buy the gorgeous yellow reissue of “Dubnobasswithmyheadman” but the “Second Toughest In The Infants” box is on the list. Underworld do a really good job on the boxes with interesting artwork to accompany the large volume of material. If the “Dubnobasswithmyheadman” box is anything to go by, the new one will be pretty hefty on the coffee table.</p></div>

<p>Normally I promise that there will be no spoilers. Not this time. There are some spoilers here. Because it took me so long to work out what I thought Satin Island was actually about, I want to use this post to explore those ideas. I promise to keep the amount of plot exposed to a minimum. Given that at first glance the novel appears plotless, I shouldn&rsquo;t have too much trouble. <strong>However, please read the novel before you read this review, unless you don&rsquo;t intend to read it.</strong></p></div>

    <div><p>As it is Halloween, I&rsquo;m writing about a spooky understated classic. Liars&rsquo; second album &ldquo;They Were Wrong, So We Drowned&rdquo; is a concept album about witches. It was the first of their albums that I owned having heard their name mentioned among those in the New York Post-punk revival scene at the start of the 00s.</p>
<p>I imagine that to most ears a first listen to &ldquo;They Were Wrong, So We Drowned&rdquo; sounds dreadful. I certainly thought so. It&rsquo;s a short album and if you plough through it there are one or two nuggets that would sound great on most albums - but a lot of it initially seems to be noise and chanting and screaming. If anyone wants to make the argument that Liars are not worth the trouble, not worth the effort to like or understand, then &ldquo;They Were Wrong, So We Drowned&rdquo; is the album they will use as ammunition.</p></div>

I&rsquo;ve not managed to read all of it yet. Also, I&rsquo;ve only glanced at the others on <a href="http://themanbookerprize.com/news/man-booker-prize-fiction-2015-shortlist-revealed">the shortlist</a>.</p>
<p>My prediction record on selecting the winner of the Booker from the shortlist is pretty good, though all I&rsquo;m ever doing is guess the outcome of a 1 in 6 chance, like the roll of a die. Often it&rsquo;s a book that I really hope will win rather than one I know will (except &ldquo;Wolf Hall&rdquo; and its sequel). I still think the world is a worse place for <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/fictionreviews/3665324/Man-Booker-2007-Prize-Darkmans.html">Nicola Barker&rsquo;s &ldquo;Darkmans&rdquo;</a> not winning the prize back in 2007. I was delighted when <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/oct/11/books.bookerprize2006">Kiran Desai&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Inheritance of Loss&rdquo; won the previous year</a>. That&rsquo;s part of my affection for &ldquo;Satin Island&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s a book that will make people go &ldquo;huh?&rdquo; if they&rsquo;re driven to reading it via a prize win.</p></div>

A shadowy sect (established by Isaac Newton no less!) recruits a soldier to go back in time and prevent Franz Ferdinand&rsquo;s assassination in Sarajevo in August 1914. I wonder if it all goes to plan and everyone lives happily ever after with no weird timey-wimey after-effects?</p>
<p>Needless to say <strong>this novel makes me wish that time travel were a real thing so that I could travel back in time and slap myself in the face while in the queue to buy this tripe.</strong> I usually try to see the best in the books, albums and movies that I write about, but the most fun you can have with this novel is to rip it to shreds.</p></div>

<p>We left La Paz, this time ascending the rim of steep hills around the city in a slightly less clunky &ldquo;Death Bus&rdquo;. Perhaps it was because we were travelling uphill or because it was daylight, but it didn&rsquo;t seem so bad.</p>

<p>We set off to Potosi through strange towns with weird monuments (see the pictures) and <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/bolivia/the-southwest/oruro/travel-tips-and-articles/76305">Oruro where great festivals happen around Ash Wednesday each year</a> that are famous throughout the continent.</p></div>

    <div><p>Y-12 is the United States&rsquo; most secure weapons-grade Uranium storage facility. It is known as the &ldquo;Fort Knox of Uranium&rdquo;. In 2012 it was infiltrated by three elderly peace protesters, sparking a major scandal about the safety of US nuclear sites. &ldquo;Gods of Metal&rdquo; by Eric Schlosser tells the story of that break-in alongside a history of both the anti-nuclear movement (in particular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plowshares_Movement">the Plowshares movement</a>) and nuclear security in the United States.</p></div>
