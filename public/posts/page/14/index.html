        <p>Jul. 14, 2016</p>
        <p><p><a href="/high-rise/">I last wrote about a JG Ballard novel nearly three years ago</a>. That one - &ldquo;High-Rise&rdquo; - <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/20/high-rise-review-ben-wheatley-jg-ballard-tom-hiddleston">has since been made into a film</a>. The subject of this post is &ldquo;The Unlimited Dream Company&rdquo;, my favourite among his novels: a silly romp through suburban sexual repression that glitters with sinister wit. Even after many read-throughs I still can&rsquo;t work out whether it is a crazy masterpiece or something light that we&rsquo;re meant to throw away after reading.</p></p>

        <p>Jul. 1, 2016</p>
        <p><p>The shiny app embedded below allows you to explore the number of packets you need to complete the Panini sticker album for this summer&rsquo;s Euro tournament. This builds on the results I presented in an [earlier post](link to earlier post) and allows you to explore how many fewer packets you need to buy when you have more friends to swap with. You can also vary the number of runs performed because the model runs considerably slower with more swappers involved.</p></p>

        <p>Jun. 30, 2016</p>
        <p><p>Album Digest June 2016 is a poppy batch of albums. We have the return of my long-time favourites Roxette and the heroes of my South American tour Tegan &amp; Sara. There&rsquo;s some dance music in the form of Flume&rsquo;s album &ldquo;Skin&rdquo;: an Australian presence ahead of the new Avalanches album next month. Finally there is the first of two new albums by Islands - both were released back in May but one gets reviewed this month and the other next month.</p></p>

        <p><p>As a follow-up to my post about the <a href="/euro-2016-panini-stickers/">Euro 2016 Panini Stickers</a>, I&rsquo;ve now completed the collection with <a href="/swaptastic-part-1/">the help of an online swapping site</a> and by buying the last 39 stickers directly from Panini. I also managed to write a new simulator, this time with additional collectors involved.</p>
<p>I assume that each of N collectors will buy a packet of stickers and add any new stickers to their album. Then they attempt to swap any leftovers with the rest of their friends. The intersect function in R makes this pretty easy to code up. Every collector who finishes the album stops buying stickers.</p></p>

        <p><p>Britain voted to leave the EU this week. It made for an angry and confused Friday morning. I posted snippy comments on Facebook at a rate of about one every fifteen minutes. I also knew that there was nothing I could do. Even when you feel like Charlton Heston at the end of &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;, you have to suck it up and accept that sometimes things don't go as you like.</p></p>

<p>Envelopes containing swaps that have arrived in the post in recent days. It is nice to get letters from all over the country, even if they do just contain a selection of <a href="/euro-2016-panini-stickers/">panini stickers</a>. As I mentioned in a previous post, I have used <a href="http://www.stickerswapping.com">the sticker swapping website</a> to share my swaps with people all over the UK. I have sent swaps off to London, Bristol, Cornwall, Lancashire, Wales, and Gloucester. You&rsquo;ll also be happy to know that I got my hands on an Aleksei Berezutski. Only 52 left to go!</p></p>

        <p>Jun. 9, 2016</p>
        <p><p>Time for a little gear review. This is the <a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/multi-device-keyboard-k380">Logitech K380 keyboard</a>. It pairs with devices wirelessly over Bluetooth. I bought it to use with my Apple TV, iPad and iPhone. It runs on 2 AAA batteries, but the supplied batteries are not rechargeable. The keyboard is light and portable but you definitely know you have it in your bag.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s lovely to type on. For a go-anywhere keyboard it has a surprisingly nice feel to the keys. It also gives equal weight to Windows and Mac keys, so it&rsquo;s quite easy to use across both platforms. The only frustration is that the iPad doesn&rsquo;t support keyboards as it should and the iPhone is even worse. I&rsquo;m expecting that to change in iOS 10, which is due to be announced at WWDC next week. Of course, none of this is the fault of the keyboard.</p></p>

        <p>Jun. 5, 2016</p>
        <p><p>Sound the conspicuous consumption klaxon! 📣 I know it&rsquo;s foolish but I decided to collect the Panini stickers for the Euro 2016 tournament this summer. I think it&rsquo;s a more edifying waste of money than a series of group game accumulators that don&rsquo;t come off. If this week&rsquo;s long read in The Guardian is anything to go by, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/31/big-gamble-dangerous-british-betting-shops">we really shouldn&rsquo;t be giving any more of our money to betting companies</a>. The album also looks better than any of the official books. Anyway, this post celebrates my inner collector/geek and the beauty of the shiny sticker!</p></p>

        <p><p>Album Digest May 2016 features the work of four bands or artists that I have reviewed in previous album digests. I also own (or will own) all of these albums on vinyl, so it&rsquo;s handy that I&rsquo;ve recently bought myself a record player!</p>
<h2 id="radiohead-a-moon-shaped-pool">Radiohead &ldquo;A Moon Shaped Pool&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Radiohead released &ldquo;A Moon Shaped Pool&rdquo; online about three weeks ago and a physical version hits the shops later in June. As with all of their recent albums, it is (mostly) a slow burner that rewards multiple listens.</p></p>

        <p><p>2016 marks the centenary of the birth of <a href="http://www.magnumphotos.com/C.aspx?VP3=CMS3&amp;VF=MAGO31_9_VForm&amp;ERID=24KL534M5N">Werner Bischof</a>, the talented Magnum photojournalist who died in Peru in 1954, aged 38. He travelled widely, making the most of an incredible talent for photography. After the second world war, this led him all over Europe to document its aftermath. As the cold war began, Bischof found himself documenting events further afield.</p>
<p>We saw two exhibitions of his photography at the <a href="http://www.elysee.ch">Musée de l&rsquo;Elysée in Lausanne</a>. &ldquo;Point of View&rdquo; explores his international work spanning the years 1945 to 1954. &ldquo;Helvetica&rdquo; explores his earlier work while isolated from travel in Switzerland during the second world war.</p></p>

        <p>May. 17, 2016</p>
        <p><p>&ldquo;Something Coming Through&rdquo; is a science fiction novel set in the near future. A few years after a brief nuclear war known as &ldquo;The Spasm&rdquo;, an alien race known as the Jackaroo introduce themselves to humanity. The novel is funny, thoughtful, and politically charged. I found it to be a good read.</p>
<p>The aliens have given humanity fifteen &ldquo;gift&rdquo; worlds and an automated way to access them. Think of the Docklands Light Railway but with space shuttles. These worlds contain artefacts and remnants from their previous occupants. Movement between the worlds has also changed the Earth: it suffers from incursions by invasive species brought back from the other worlds.</p></p>

        <p><p>This month&rsquo;s album digest is a mixture of comparisons. First we compare the fortunes of old hands Underworld to even older hands the Pet Shop Boys. After that I&rsquo;ve found two dance albums, one that I liked and one that I didn&rsquo;t. I find it quite hard to write about dance music and so the comparison is quite useful. Sometimes it helps to work out why you like one thing and not another.</p></p>
