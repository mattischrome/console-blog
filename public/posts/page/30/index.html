        <p><p>I’ve found twitter to be a bit boring lately but today a perfect storm brew up and once again the Daily Mail and one of its odious columnists was at its centre. Melanie Phillips’ opinion piece was a perfectly constructed piece of trolling that implied that since the repeal of section 28, schools have been flooded with an influx of gay propaganda in subjects like maths, history and geography. Well I’m all for it, Alan Turing <em>was</em> a genius brutally mistreated by his country despite turning the second world war in favour of the allies - that story is maths and history is combined. Meanwhile, if you can spice up geography a bit go for it. I am not sure what you would do, discuss routes for pride marches? After all, the subject is hideously out of date now that we all have google maps on our phones.</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 9, 2011</p>
        <p><p>Idewild are a solid band who have released four or five albums that I could consider for this series. I&rsquo;m even in the sleeve credits of one: <em>Post-Electric Blues</em>, if you&rsquo;re asking.</p>
<p>In the end I went for <em>100 Broken Windows</em> because it means a lot to me. It has more of a place in my life than the others. Usually I find that this happens if I can remember where I bought an album. In this case I bought a copy of the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22533522">cassette</a> in Bath HMV at Easter 2000. I can remember the first time that I listened to it too, it was as I marched home to Oldfield Park down Bathwick hill from the <a href="www.bath.ac.uk">university</a> that same afternoon. It took exactly the two sides of the tape to get from one door to the other.</p></p>

        <p><h4 id="a-new-year-a-new-hobby">A new year, a new hobby</h4>
<p>I don’t write about programming enough. This is a shame because it is a very interesting subject and I find that the problem solving aspects of programming are very satisfying. Keenly aware of the need to do more hobby programming and to get up to speed on areas of software development that I’ve been neglecting, I have decided to give myself the project of creating a computerised version of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_(card_game)">UNO card game</a>. I know that one already exists, for example there’s an official one that you can play on MSN messenger.</p></p>

<p>Three letters for Dad in the mail today, three variations on our surname including the aquatic <em>Dory</em> version and the lesser-spotted <em>Dorny</em>. It is perhaps best not to go back to the time he was accidentally listed in the Thompson directory as Mr. Dopey, bringing forth prank calls from all teenagers within a ten mile radius. Fortunately, Dr. Dorey doesn’t have this problem with his mail: he doesn’t get any.</p></p>

<p>Ask anyone into pop music between 1991 and 1993 about The Shamen, and you&rsquo;ll either receive a flood of euphoric good will about excellent tracks like <em>Move Any Mountain</em>, <em>LSI</em>, and <em>Phorever People</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>; or they will rant at you about the evils of <em>Ebeneezer Goode</em>. The Shamen are either one of the pantheon of great acts from early 90&rsquo;s dance and electronic music, or they are a shameless vaudeville novelty act.</p></p>

        <p><p>Since the run there has been a bit of a hiatus in this blog. I wrote about how running was making me feel better. In fact, I should have said more. I recently stopped taking the antidepressants that I had been taking for eighteen months. This has been my longest period taking such medication but the running made me feel sufficiently good to decide that I could stop taking them.</p></p>

        <p><p>So, Saturday. Finally. The big day. Would I a) be able to get to Greenwich in time for the registration? and b) be able to make it all the way around the course without collapsing and crying?</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/images/other/movember01.jpg" alt="Picture of Matt at Movember 10K run 2010"></p>
<p>Happily the answer to both questions was a resounding “Yes!” and I really enjoyed it. The weather was really good, especially compared to the two days before hand, and Marc came along to take some brilliant photos.</p></p>

<p>This is the youngest album I have chosen for this series. I try to pick albums that are at least ten years old but every now and then, I will think of an album that matches the sort of things I want to write about. That&rsquo;s the case here. <em>A Weekend in the City</em> is an unusual album that, in a reversal of the old adage, is “easy to love but hard to admire”. Nevertheless I do love and admire it, and I would like to share my thoughts about it with you.</p></p>

<p>At last, Ballard in full flow. The Crystal World (TCW) is definitely the most enjoyable of the early trio of apocalyptic novels. It takes the successful elements of the first two and embellishes them with new details and ideas. At time of writing, TCW is definitely the best Ballard novel that I have read in its entirety.</p>
<p>The book begins with a steamer travelling up a river in Cameroon carrying the novel’s main protagonist Edward Sanders, a doctor at a hospital for lepers. He is hoping to meet some friends, Max and Suzanne Clair, who are also doctors and run another leprosy hospital in a town named Mount Royal (also the name of the main city in “The Drought”). His motives are not entirely clear and we are given introspection into his doubts about the reasons he is making the journey. The inference is that he had an affair with Suzanne Clair and may well still be in love with her.</p></p>

<p>I bought this album in the summer between my two years at college. I remember listening to this music under skies glowering with clouds so 1997 must have been a poor summer. I’d just bought a book of photography too, which placed photos from the north and south poles on opposite pages. I bought it mainly for the penguins that were, of course, on pretty much every other page. The pictures of snow and ice soon became the ideal companions to this album.</p></p>

        <p><h2 id="the-world-created-by-nature-versus-the-world-constructed-by-humans">The world created by nature versus the world constructed by humans</h2>
<p>On to The Drought by J. G. Ballard in <a href="/j-g-ballard/">my ongoing quest to read and review all of his novels</a>. This is his second novel, if we assume his convention of never acknowledging “The Wind From Nowhere” as being his first novel. “The Drought” itself was renamed from “The Burning World” and additional content added later on. This was quite common practice in SF in the 50s and 60s where novels were serialised in magazines like <a href="http://philsp.com/mags/amazing_stories.html">Amazing SF</a> and <a href="http://ttapress.com/interzone/about/">Interzone</a>. It is evidence though of Ballard finding his voice as he wrote and from The Drought it is easy to see that he is iterating his thought processes and subject matter with each novel.</p></p>

        <p><h2 id="when-is-understated-not-understated">When is understated not understated?</h2>
<p>The trouble with writing a series of articles all themed somehow is that eventually you might find something that sits naturally in the sequence but at the same time goes against the grain a little. Et voila, I give you “The Circle &amp; The Square” by <a href="http://www.redboxmusic.net/htm/home.htm">Red Box</a>. An album that hardly anyone has heard containing two top 10 UK singles that probably everyone has heard. Don’t get me wrong, it is a complete and utter classic - but it is definitely not understated: it is pompous, pretentious, ornate, artistic, all-encompassing, weird and awesome. I could continue but some innate inner law prevents me from using any more adjectives than that in one sentence. It is a chimeral entity standing way apart from its time, timeless and beautiful. The fact that it sold sod-all copies means that holding <a href="http://www.cherryred.co.uk/cherrypop-exd.asp?id=873">a CD remaster</a> makes you feel as if you were clutching a cuddly dodo and thinking “if only, if only…”. So this barking, bonkers, beautiful album gets its “<a href="/tags#understated-classics/">understated classic</a>” status because it just isn’t stated often enough just what an amazing record it is.</p></p>
