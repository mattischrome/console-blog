My appearance on Mastermind with “The Films of Wes Anderson” as my specialist subject will have to wait for now. Feel free to add to the discussion in the comments. In case you don’t know what the films are, here they are in order (with links to their IMDB pages):</p></div>

Most notably perhaps is this book “on love” by Helen Fisher. Lest there is any innuendo it is not a book about technique nor does it attempt to explain love to those who have never known it, instead it assumes that we have all been there. In fact, the book attempts to explain the neurological mechanisms of love (specifically romantic love) and describes how science has helped reveal these mechanisms to us.</p></div>

<p>More books to add to the “University of life” course list. From top to bottom: I picked up “Generation X” for 50p in a charity shop in Tintagel. “Everything Is Going To Be OK” is a picture book full of inspirational mottos. “The Happiness Hypothesis” is the most useful and interesting book that I have read in a long while. I decided to read “How To Write A Sentence” as an alternative to Strunk and White’s “The Elements Of Style” which, while useful, can be a little stuffy! “The Marriage Plot” is a novel with interesting reviews, it was also (ahem) well-priced. After love I decided to go after music as something else I wanted to read about, hence “The Music Instinct” which comes highly recommended. “The Gifts Of Imperfection” is a manifesto for embracing life in a wholehearted way. And “Gonzo”? Well, <a href="/gonzo-a-graphic-biography-of-hunter-s-thompson/">I have written about that one already</a>.</p></div>

    <div><p>This arrived on Monday and I thought I would give it a post of its own because at over 3 hours of music, I am unlikely to do more than dip into it before writing the album digest next week. It is a far bigger and more enjoyable artefact than I thought it was going to be, so it probably deserves special attention for that reason too.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_(band)">CAN</a> are a German (“<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krautrock">Krautrock</a>”) band that I got into about four years ago after my interest in the genre was sparked by the “Neu! 75” album and the Kraftwerk box set. I have four of CAN&rsquo;s albums and I have thought about which one I should include as an <a href="understated-classics">understated classic</a>. It will probably be “Soon Over Babaluma” because no one really writes about that one. Then again, Portishead’s “Third” probably wouldn’t sound as awesome as it does without the influence of “Ege Bamyasi”, so that might be worth considering too. Everyone writes about “Tago Mago” and “Future Days” but for good reason.</p></div>

It was a real treat in every sense. To start with, the Everyman is a lovely cinema. It is quite expensive but you do get what you pay for: a comfortable seat in a great theatre and the chance to watch more than just the latest blockbusters (though it shows those too). I think it was the only cinema in my area that was showing <em>Moonrise Kingdom</em>, though it has been out for a while now.</p></div>

<p>The <a href="album-digest-april-2012">April album digest</a> was rather short on songs, so this month I decided to look for albums that were more based around songs not tracks. Electronic music is relatively easy to write about: the music is often simple (but not always), there are recognisable structures and genres (but not always), and there are conventions that are adhered to (but not always). The repetition of those parenthetical “not always” means that while the writing is easy, it is also often quite fun.</p></div>

<p>I am quite keen on Orbital, though perhaps not as keen as I am on the similarly named Orb. I think I have got all the Orbital albums, mostly bought on eBay after the fact. (Funny story though, I did find a copy of <em>In Sides</em> in the loft of a house where I lived in Bath, along with several other albums…) My favourite Orbital album is probably <em>Snivilisation</em> but they all have their moments, whether it is the genuine sliver of emotion shot through <em>Halcyon</em> off the brown album, the proggy long-form tracks on <em>In Sides</em> like <em>The Girl With The Sun In Her Head</em> or <em>Out There Somewhere</em> (parts one and two), or indeed the arsing about with heavy metal samples on tracks like <em>Tension</em> off the highly underrated <em>The Altogether</em>.</p></div>

<p>A hefty reading list that should keep me occupied into the summer. A friend on facebook asked “What course is that for?”, to which I replied “It’s for one of the modules I am doing at the university of life.” This response was quite popular.</p></div>

<p><em>Nearly God</em> is Tricky’s second album, which was released under a different name either because Island rejected it as the follow-up to <em>Maxinequaye</em> or because it came too quickly after and Tricky just wanted it released. I had this album before <em>Maxinequaye</em> because back then it wasn’t as easy to go back and catch up with albums that you had missed as it is now. I had bought enough singles to get the postcards through the post that advertised <em>Nearly God</em> (this, kids, is what we had before e-mail and liking things on Facebook) and when I heard <em>Poems</em> for the first time on the radio I was incredibly excited.</p></div>

Nuzzles the sugary<br>

Billows the silvered<br>
Violet silks<br>
Of the south - a tenderness<br>
Lifting through all the<br>
Gently-breasted<br>
Counties of England.</p></div>
