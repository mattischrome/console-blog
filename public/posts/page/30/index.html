        <p><p>Some rather brief pen pictures of this month’s albums. I’ve been a bit busy!</p>
<h2 id="radio-slave---collected-remixes">Radio Slave - Collected Remixes</h2>
<p>Thud thud thud. This is pretty much how all Radio Slave remixes go. I really liked his fabric mix and borrowed a few tracks for a playlist I made called &ldquo;Dancing In Space&rdquo;. Anyway, back to the thudding: it’s no bad thing, the remixes have a nice formula that works well for discovering new tracks like UNKLE’s <em>Burn My Shadow</em> (Ian Astbury’s vocal is given plenty of room to shine) and K3’s <em>Play To Win</em>.</p></p>

        <p>Nov. 22, 2011</p>
        <p><p>My earliest memory is waking up in Queen Alexandra hospital in Cosham after an operation on my ears. I must have been about four years old and it was the middle of the night. I was in a room on my own and the door was locked. It had been daylight only seconds before so I got out of the bed and walked to the window to look incredulously out at the amber world that lay beyond.</p></p>

        <p>Nov. 20, 2011</p>
        <p><p>Just three albums this month as I’ve been listening to a lot of Brian Eno records ready for an upcoming understated classic. First up is <em>50 Words For Snow</em> by <strong>Kate Bush</strong>, the second album that she has released this year. <a href="album-digest-may-2011">Back in May</a> I wrote about <em>Director’s Cut</em>, which presented re-recorded and re-mastered versions of songs from her albums <em>The Sensual World</em> and <em>The Red Shoes</em>. This time around it is an album of brand new material, the first since <em>Aerial</em> in 2006.</p></p>

        <p>Nov. 7, 2011</p>
        <p><blockquote>
<p>I think it’s time to discuss your philosophy of drug use as it relates to artistic endeavour…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That quote is from the movie “The Naked Lunch” directed by David Cronenburg (see also <a href="/crash/">this</a>) and it also opens “Bug Powder Dust” by Bomb The Bass, the five star single that opens “Clear”. A rollicking piece of rock rap dripping with pop culture references that runs for four and half minutes and does not stop until another quote from “The Naked Lunch”, it is probably one of my favourite songs of the 90s. That churning guitar line sends me right back.</p></p>

        <p>Nov. 3, 2011</p>
        <p><p>There was much excitement about <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1598778/">Contagion</a> at work. Finally a movie that explains  as part of the plot! A bunch of us went to see it, mainly to see whether <a href="http://contagionmovie.warnerbros.com/index.html">a disaster movie about a global pandemic</a> could hold up as entertainment and to have a bit of a giggle if it couldn’t.</p>
<p>I liked three things in particular about the film. I liked the cinematography, especially the opening sequences with the index cases staggering around. I liked the soundtrack except for when it intruded a bit too much into proceedings. Finally, I liked Marion Cotillard, who seems to be in every interesting movie at the moment.</p></p>

        <h1><a href="http://localhost:1313/posts/the-philosopher-and-the-wolf/" title="Mark Rowlands, The Philosopher And The Wolf">Mark Rowlands, The Philosopher And The Wolf</a></h1>
        <p>Nov. 2, 2011</p>
        <p><p>I saw that a friend had ‘liked’ this book on Facebook and reading about it on <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Philosopher-Wolf-Lessons-Death-Happiness/dp/1847081029/">amazon</a>, I was curious enough to give it a go. It is the autobiography of the philosopher <a href="http://rowlands.philospot.com/">Mark Rowlands</a>, specifically the experiences and lessons learned from raising a wolf, Brenin, from cub to maturity and beyond.</p>
<p>The book addresses different aspects of philosophy including the nature of evil and the interaction between humans and other animals. As you might expect, the book pays particular attention to our interactions with wolves and dogs. There is also a lot of explanation of the difference between wolves and dogs. Rowlands appears often to disparage dogs, though remembering my experiences of our Labradors while growing up did make me nod in agreement quite often.</p></p>

<h2 id="album-digest-october-2011---intro">Album Digest October 2011 - Intro</h2>
<p>I listened to Wilco’s <em>The Whole Love</em> again the other day. I happened to be walking past the venue in Portsmouth where I went to see them live back in 2004 and it seemed the right fit. I really enjoyed the album after a period of not having listened to it and I found that being familiar with the songs allowed me to better appreciate the production of the album. It really is better than I had said last time when I included it in the <a href="/2011/09/album-digest-september-2011/">September Album Digest</a>, I suppose that it was the danger in writing about music you have only had with you for a few weeks (or days in the case of <em>The Whole Love</em>).</p></p>

        <p>Sep. 30, 2011</p>
        <p><p>Hmmm, a rather grey looking selection of covers this month. The albums I have listened to most are:</p>
<ol>
<li>John Beltran <em>Ambient Selections</em></li>
<li>FabricLive 59 mixed by Four Tet</li>
<li>The Rapture <em>In The Grace Of Your Love</em></li>
<li>Wilco <em>The Whole Love</em></li>
</ol>
<p>I have actually only had the Wilco album since Monday of this week (the 26th) but it has inveigled its way into my consciousness quite quickly. As I have said before, <a href="/2010/playlist-1-metallic/">this blog owes its name to a Wilco song</a> and they are quite an important band to me. The other albums are mostly electronic, although The Rapture are distinctly indie flavoured as they hit the dance floor.</p></p>

        <p>Sep. 9, 2011</p>
        <p><p><strong>FUN FACT:</strong> It was because of the artwork to this album that I obsessively scrawled onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome onourwayhome on my pencil case at school. I also had a very passable u.f.orb logo drawn on it too.</p>
<h2 id="in-the-blue-room">In The Blue Room</h2>
<p>I had my first “close encounter” with The Orb in 1992 when the single <em>Blue Room</em> was in the charts. Back then, as I <a href="uc2">mentioned previously</a>, I would listen to the radio a lot and this tune - introduced as the longest single ever to enter the UK chart - struck me as really interesting. The radio edit was a burbling wash of synths and female vocals underpinned by a hefty bass performance from <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/music/2008/06/wobble-life-music-dub-leaving">Jah Wobble</a>. Incidentally, the same week that <em>Blue Room</em> entered the chart, I was actually listening out for <em>Sentinel</em> by Mike Oldfield and this single (<a href="uc10">from Tubular Bells II</a>) featured two remixes by The Orb.</p></p>

        <p>Sep. 9, 2011</p>
        <p><p>A week or so ago, I finished reading <em>Dune</em> by Frank Herbert. It tells the story of a revolution within a Galactic Empire that takes place on a harsh and unforgiving desert planet called Arrakis. One central theme is how destinies can be shaped despite being intertwined around many axes. Another is the importance of adaptation in the fight for survival.</p>
<p>I came to <em>Dune</em> via the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087182/">David Lynch film</a> and then <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Herbert%27s_Dune">the Sci-Fi Channel’s mini-series</a>, which I was able to <a href="http://www.lovefilm.com/film/Dune-Part-1/161663/">stream through LoveFilm</a>. Of the two filmed versions, I found the latter to be more enjoyable and this is almost certainly because it runs to nearly six hours. The 1984 film runs to over 3 hours and yet still feels rather rushed. The Lynch version is to be praised though as in my opinion it develops a unique aesthetic for the Dune universe that I did not detect so much in the book.</p></p>

        <p>Aug. 31, 2011</p>
        <p><p>I bought a collection of electronic music this month. I mixed them all up in a smart playlist on iTunes, the smart aspect being to limit to tracks that had been played fewer than five then six then seven times etc. This made sure I was still listening to all the tracks equally often, despite the randomness.</p>
<ol>
<li>Biosphere <em>N-plants</em></li>
<li>Ford &amp; Lopatin <em>Channel Pressure</em></li>
<li>Gus Gus <em>Arabian Horse</em></li>
<li>Instra:Mental <em>Resolution 653</em></li>
<li>Jon Tejada <em>Parabolas</em></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="biosphere-_n-plants_">Biosphere <em>N-Plants</em></h2>
<p>I think this album makes Biosphere the most reviewed musician on this blog at the moment but I don’t mind too much, he makes some great stuff. <em>N-Plants</em> is a series of pieces about Japanese nuclear power plants and was ready for release by about February this year, just before the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_nuclear_disaster">Fukishima nuclear disaster</a> in March. It ended up being released in June. I am not sure if this represents a delay or not but as this quote shows, <a href="http://www.touchmusic.org.uk/catalogue/to84_biosphere_nplants.html">Geir Jenssen is aware of how spooky the timing was</a>.</p></p>

        <p><h2 id="happy-birthday">Happy Birthday!</h2>
<p>No matter how intellectual one gets about these things, the primary function of music is to have fun. With this in mind it is a good time to turn to Roxette then, as they are almost always the epitome of fun.</p>
<p>I received <em>Look Sharp!</em> as a present for my ninth birthday. This was probably a bit young to fully understand all the emotions expressed on the record. It’s just as well that it is also crammed with the kind of pop confections that made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Bore_Us,_Get_to_the_Chorus!">“Don’t bore us, get to the chorus!”</a> something of a band motto and made for a great introduction to the world of pop for a nine year old boy.</p></p>
