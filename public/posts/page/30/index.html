        <p>May. 6, 2011</p>
        <p><h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p><em>Tiger Bay</em> is Saint Etienne&rsquo;s third album and I think it is among their best. It was released in June 1994 on Heavenly records. I first owned a copy in 1998 when I picked it up while living in halls as an undergraduate. The reason for including this album in the understated classics series is the same as for <a href="uc8"><em>Second Light</em></a> by Dreadzone: it marries traditional forms to newer electronic music<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. <em>Second Light</em> melds classical music and sea shanties to house and dub reggae to evoke the rolling hills and mystic caves of England. <em>Tiger Bay</em> grafts folk structures on to Balearic pop songs and electronic experiments in order to visit motorway verges, windswept seashores, and Mediterranean holidays. There is even a ghost story (<em>Boy Scouts of America</em>) for good measure.</p></p>

        <p>May. 5, 2011</p>
        <p><p>The other day while writing some rather self-pitying notes in my blog book (yes, I handwrite all this rubbish before I go to bed at night!) I came up with some useless superheroes, or rather the only superheroes that a washed-up guy in his early thirties could hope to be. Because I haven’t got any ideas for “five things on the fifth” this month, I decided to flesh out a few of these. Last month I began the five on the fifth meme with <a href="five-things-to-try-when-you-cant-sleep">five things to try if you can’t sleep</a> and so this is a rather forced attempt to keep it going. I promise that I will try and think of more interesting posts on these lines for months.</p></p>

        <p><h2 id="album-of-the-month-_mirrorwriting_-by-jamie-woon">Album of the month: <em>Mirrorwriting</em> by Jamie Woon</h2>
<p>Jamie Woon was brought to my attention late last year by Pitchfork who wrote an article about the video for lead single <em>Night Air</em>. I’ve put that video down below because I think that it is very good, a simple well executed and the tune itself is brilliant, probably my favourite individual track of 2010. It’s a downtempo tune full of dark spaces and empty beats, full of nocturnal promise and mystery. Hungry for more, I also bought the <em>Wayfaring Stranger</em> EP and pre-ordered <em>Mirrorwriting</em> as soon as it was possible.</p></p>

        <p>Apr. 6, 2011</p>
        <p><p>I saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090563/">Betty Blue</a> (original French title <em>37,2 Le Matin</em>) for the first time in 1996 shortly after having read the book and it remains one of my favourite films to this day. Although there are <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/images?hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;biw=1427&amp;bih=1022&amp;q=b%C3%A9atrice+dalle+betty+blue&amp;gbv=2&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;oq=&amp;uss=1">many obvious reasons why</a> a sixteen year old boy might like it, I think it does stand up to scrutiny beyond the sex and nudity. This post is a brief explanation of some of the obvious and not-so-obvious reasons why this is a film to be loved and cherished. (It was quite interesting to write this defence of a sexy film!)</p></p>

        <p>Apr. 5, 2011</p>
        <p><p>Facebook is wonderful for keeping in touch but I’ve noticed that quite a few of my friends tend to use it to tell the world that they can’t sleep. Here’s some advice for you if you find yourself unable to sleep one night. I’ve often had to try these out myself! Note that these are just things that work for me and your mileage may vary, particularly if you are fortunate enough to have a partner next to you! You may need to appease them if you wriggle around too much.</p></p>

        <p>Apr. 3, 2011</p>
        <p><p>As I mentioned before <a href="more-books">I am re-reading the novels of Iain Banks</a> and this weekend I managed to finish <em>Consider Phlebas</em>. A little post about it will be coming up soon. One of my favourite things about the Culture novels is how the ships are named and having found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ships_(The_Culture)">a list on Wikipedia</a>, I thought I would share ten of my favourites with you!</p>
<ol>
<li><em>You’ll Clean That Up Before You Leave</em></li>
<li><em>Ravished By The Sheer Implausibility Of That Last Statement</em></li>
<li><em>All Through With This Niceness And Negotiation Stuff</em></li>
<li><em>Prosthetic Conscience</em></li>
<li><em>Of Course I Still Love You</em></li>
<li><em>Size Isn’t Everything</em></li>
<li><em>Hand Me The Gun And Ask Me Again</em></li>
<li><em>Dramatic Exit, Or, Thank you And Goodnight</em></li>
<li><em>We Haven’t Met But You’re A Great Fan Of Mine</em></li>
<li><em>Anticipation Of A New Lover’s Arrival, The</em></li>
</ol>
<p>Great names all I am sure you would agree. Not all of them appear as fully developed characters. In fact (and I will mention this again later) the ships don’t get nearly enough time as characters in the novels apart from <em>Excession</em>, which is almost entirely devoted to them. In that novel, one ship is central to the story and is probably my favourite, an eccentric GCU (General Contact Unit) called <em>Grey Area</em> that has been shunned by the other machines for “non-consensual mind reading”. It turns out the ship is somewhat morbid and likes to confront the perpetrators of genocides with their crimes. It is known by the other ships as “the meatf***er” and is totally badass.</p></p>

<p>Well as I said at the end of <a href="/album-digest-february-2011/">last month’s album digest post</a>, I took a bit of a break from pursuing new music quite as closely as I have been. As promised, I sidestepped the new R.E.M. and Elbow albums - although I had been promised the latter as a birthday present it is yet to show up, maybe I will look at in April.</p></p>

        <p><h2 id="never-mind-the-ballards">Never mind the Ballards</h2>
<p>I have been writing about books by <a href="j-g-ballard">J.G. Ballard</a> pretty much to the exclusion of all others. Gradually the posts have tricked out about four novels and ground to a halt. I’ve got a fair way through two other books but I am getting very tired of reading his novels all the time, much as I love them. The mistake I made was that I hadn’t read enough of them in the first place. The project for the site was get the books, read them and then write something. In terms of writing regular posts, this was a bad idea!</p></p>

        <p>Mar. 17, 2011</p>
        <p><p>In the <a href="understated-classics">understated classics</a> series, I try to alternate between pop/rock and electronic albums. Keeping with this trend number eight is the wonderful dub-infused album <em>Second Light</em> by <a href="http://www.dreadzone.com">Dreadzone</a>. Released in 1996 it was well-received critically and four of its tracks featured on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/">John Peel</a>&rsquo;s best-of-year list that year. <em>Little Britain</em> received a lot of radio play, a popular choice for that flag-waving period of <a href="http://www.mojo4music.com/13834/the-story-of-britpop-in-60-albums/">britpop</a> and assorted other demons.</p>
<p>The strengths of <em>Second Light</em> as an album is the anglicana<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> of its first half and the subversion of it in the second half. I often talk of how albums are front-loaded with the best tracks to get you immersed in them. This is probably a hangover from vinyl where you could repeatedly play one side, making it necessary to make cohesive &lsquo;sides&rsquo; of music.</p></p>

        <p><p>February, the shortest month, harbinger of such delights as Groundhog Day and Valentine’s Day. Could it possibly produce any good albums? Well the candidates are the eponymous début album by <strong>James Blake</strong>, <em>Zonoscope</em> by <strong>Cut/Copy</strong>, <em>Let England Shake</em> by <strong>PJ Harvey</strong> and <em>Smart Flesh</em> by <strong>The Low Anthem</strong>. Furthermore, there was an unexpected bonus when <a href="http://www.radiohead.com/deadairspace/"><strong>Radiohead</strong></a> announced that their new album would be out and available to listen to this month too.</p></p>

        <p><p>Hurrah for more exoplanets <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2011/feb/02/new-planets-solar-system">making the news</a> this week. This time it is a star with a whole bunch of small planets very close to the star, usually they tend to be single gas giants larger even than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter">Jupiter</a> as this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_exoplanetary_host_stars">list of stars with exoplanets</a> from Wikipedia shows.</p>
<p>But these stars are all so far away! The closest star with an exoplanet found in orbit around it so far is 10 light years away (Epsilon Eridani) and this week’s system was found over 2000 light years away. To put this in perspective, Voyager 2 is <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Voyager2/status/32589239199731713">currently 11 hours 13 minutes and 52 seconds of light travel from Earth</a> just over 33 years after launch. It hasn’t really left our solar system yet - it is twice as far from the sun as Pluto but not as far as planet X - and according to current calculations it will next encounter a star (Sirius) in 290,000 years time, by which time it will be 8.6 light years from Earth and its instruments will be long dead.</p></p>

        <p>Feb. 2, 2011</p>
        <p><p>It turns out that programming the UNO game is not that complicated once you start designing the thing. This post will get the rules and game elements clear.</p>
<h4 id="the-deck">The deck</h4>
<p>An UNO deck consists of four sets of coloured cards (red, yellow, green and blue) together with eight wild cards. The non-wild cards are marked with either numbers or special symbols. The numbers range from zero to nine with two of each number except for the zero, which is unique. For each colour there are also two each of three kinds of special card: SKIP, SWAP and DRAW. The eight wild cards are divided into four each of two types: WILD and WILDFOUR. The wild cards are usually black in UNO decks so we may refer to them as black cards on occasion. There are one hundred and eight cards in total.</p></p>
