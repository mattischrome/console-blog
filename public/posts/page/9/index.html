        <p>Jan. 4, 2021</p>
        <p><p>Writing this post came about from  frustration with blogging. Specifically the tools I am using. Often it feels like a new language or paradigm comes along that shifts one or two of the pain points of blogging. The biggest are:</p>
<ol>
<li>How long it takes to get a post on the internet once you’ve written it</li>
<li>The reliability of the resulting website</li>
<li>How good the resulting website looks</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that none of this really impacts the quality of the writing. I’m not claiming to be a good writer: in fact I spend so much time blogging or thinking about blogging because it is my writing practice. (I think I am getting better, but slowly).</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 3, 2021</p>
        <p><p>This Is How You Lose the Time War is a short novella about two members of opposing factions (Red and Blue) engaged in a &rsquo;time war’: that is they travel in time and attempt to erase each other&rsquo;s existence. Except that one day Red decides to taunt Blue with a letter, and a correspondence emerges.</p>
<p>The book is entertaining by virtue of wit and brevity. However, the elements that are skipped over that end up being more interesting to reflect on later. Clearly these are two talented writers bouncing ideas off one another, but you get a  sense that this whole fictional universe might have developed into something more. I was more interested in individual episodes than in the correspondence and its results. Perhaps the writers have ended up constrained by their witty idea.</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 2, 2021</p>
        <p><p>Last year I started to write a review of Italo Calvino&rsquo;s &ldquo;If on a Winter&rsquo;s Night a Traveller&rdquo;. I read it while we were in Germany for Christmas. We&rsquo;d visited Bremen and also undergone the bizarreness of Christmas in another language - the same motifs played out in different words and different customs. I&rsquo;d tried to write the review in a similar structure to the book but, in a testament to Calvino&rsquo;s writing I couldn&rsquo;t pull it off. Here&rsquo;s the opening paragraph:</p></p>

        <p><blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The mind may give up its desire to improve on creation and function as a faithful receiver of experience.&rdquo; John Cage</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After enjoying <a href="/the-overstory/"><em>The Overstory</em></a>, I wanted to read more of Richard Powers&rsquo; novels. <em>Orfeo</em>  was also long listed for the Booker prize. Perhaps more of his novels would have been had the prize been opened to American authors earlier.</p>
<p><em>Orfeo</em> is about Peter Els, a seventy year old composer who accidentally alerts Homeland Security to the existence of his home laboratory, in which he has been trying to recode the genetic material of a bacterium to include a piece of his music. He ends up on the run, which provides the catalyst for a narrative in which we ponders the past and returns to it. Woven throughout is a history of contemporary classical music, most real and some invented.</p></p>

        <p>Dec. 31, 2020</p>
        <p><p>I’ve listened to music in slightly different ways to normal in the last nine months, but it’s still been a decent year for music. When I checked out my Spotify Unwrapped and my Last.fm reports, I had listened to more 2020 music than I thought.</p>
<h2 id="december">December</h2>
<p>Album of the month had to be &ldquo;We Will Always Love You&rdquo; by the Avalanches. One of only three albums that I bought physical copies of this year, it combines my favourite musical genres and has a novel take on the spacey-sounding album: like something beamed into space about how great humans are. That&rsquo;s probably something we needed to be reminded of come the end of the year. In many ways, the Fermi paradox reminds us that quarantine and isolation are in many ways the default human condition. Even so, a signal to the outside universe must be sent.</p></p>

        <p>Oct. 8, 2020</p>
        <p><p>Recently I&rsquo;ve had cause to dig out some old photos. If I&rsquo;m honest it&rsquo;s made me sad. Sadder than I was expecting. There&rsquo;s a quote from Nan Goldin that once felt like a warning but now just sounds like a sad statement of ongoing affairs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I used to think that I could never lose anyone if I photographed them enough. In fact, my pictures show me how much I’ve lost.”</p></p>

        <p>Jul. 7, 2020</p>
        <p><p>I decided to create my own deck of creativity cards. I was sick of all the adverts for similar products on Instagram. You know the kind. They&rsquo;re covered in pictures, patterns, and buzzwords. You shuffle the cards and draw them one at a time. As you place each card on the table, the brain’s natural desire to tell stories, create patterns and produce meaning takes over.</p>
<p>I made a deck without too much thought for form or consequence. It was an unconscious collection of signs and symbols. The peaks of curves. Greek letters. Compartments, boxes, arrows. I told myself that I could create new things like this. I could break out of old mannerisms and entrenched thinking.</p></p>

        <p>Jun. 11, 2020</p>
        <p><p>&ldquo;He keeps biting me on the leg&rdquo; says Ingrid one day as I mill around her desk during the new water cooler moment that is a comfort break on a Microsoft Teams call. I pat Martok, one of our cats, and he rubs up against me, pretending that he might nibble at me too.</p>
<p>I experience this regularly. It used to be at half five, then at five, and these days at half past four. He strides into my office, circles around the chair and nips me on the calf. I don&rsquo;t know why it&rsquo;s getting earlier each day. It&rsquo;s probably a brazen campaign for dinner, but I have been steadfast in feeding them no earlier than the S of six.</p></p>

        <p>Jun. 1, 2020</p>
        <p><p>This post explains some of the modifications I made to a minimal Jekyll theme to get this blog as I wanted it. This blog (currently) uses the excellent <a href="https://sidey-jekyll.netlify.app/about">Sidey theme</a> by <a href="https://www.ronaldsvilcins.com">Ronalds Vilciņš</a>. His site looks eerily similar to this one, at least at time of writing.</p>
<p>The theme is pretty minimal in terms of features (and appearance) but it scores well on the Google Page Speed test. The features I added have increased the build time, but have not affected the speed of the site in terms of the page speed test.</p></p>

        <p>May. 31, 2020</p>
        <p><p>While sprucing up this blog a bit during lockdown, I fell into reading my old posts about <a href="/tag/south%20america/">South America</a>. I enjoyed it, mostly for the memories, but also because the current lockdown is warping my sense of time and space. Hours feel like weeks, but then I blink and a month&rsquo;s gone by. I find myself traipsing similar orbits each day around the house, and then perhaps over to the supermarket or the park. There&rsquo;s a palpable escapism to be had in reminiscing about South America and other places.</p></p>

        <p>May. 30, 2020</p>
        <p><p>Over the course of a week on holiday, I started reading many interesting articles. In lockdown there isn&rsquo;t much to do but read articles, but I still find myself not that good at finishing them. My phone has lots of tabs open and has become a Rolodex of shame. This post is to confess my sins.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to re-familiarise myself with Python. As with all modern software development, Python now seems atomised and hyper-complicated. As a result, this series of posts from Claudio Jolowitz was useful. He cuts through lots of the complications and explains why they are there. Someone should ask him to write a book.</p></p>

        <p><p>Ingrid bought me a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org">raspberry pi</a> for my birthday. I&rsquo;ve set it up to run the <a href="https://docs.pi-hole.net">Pi-hole</a> software. Pi-hole is a nifty bit of kit that intercepts your web requests and purges any that ask for material on known ad servers. Essentially it&rsquo;s like having an ad blocker on your network rather than just your computer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written before about <a href="/net-loss/">why I hate web advertising</a>, and since then it&rsquo;s got even more malign. The use of our web browsing habits to track our every move and sell us crap has gotten way worse. Instagram is particularly <em>awful</em> for it and gets more awful with every amendment that Facebook makes. An ad-blocking solution that works for apps as well as in the browser is especially welcome.</p></p>
