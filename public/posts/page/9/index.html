        <p>Dec. 17, 2017</p>
        <p>We left Gulfoss and drove through the countryside to Fluðir where our next hotel stay would be. The hotel had cute little cabins arranged around a central square and the room itself was comfy and warm. Our dinner was nice enough, although we had a bit of a Fawlty Towers moment with Ingrid’s chicken salad. First it went back because they didn’t leave the BBQ sauce off. Then it came back with tomatoes.</p>

        <p>00110100 01010100 &ldquo;0181&rdquo; This is a reissue of a Four Tet rarity from 2013 that has recently surfaced on Spotify under an alias1. &ldquo;0181&rdquo; collects a series of short experimental pieces from throughout his career, though I&rsquo;m not enough of a nerd to know whether they are in any particular order. Last month&rsquo;s &lsquo;proper&rsquo; Four Tet album &ldquo;New Energy&rdquo; has a lot more bounce to it, but &ldquo;0181&rdquo; nevertheless has some interesting moments that raises it above mere curiosity.</p>

        <p>Nov. 15, 2017</p>
        <p>In a perfect confluence of last month&rsquo;s album digest, here&rsquo;s an excellent Four Tet remix of Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith&rsquo;s &ldquo;I Will Make Room For You&rdquo; from her album &ldquo;The Kid&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve put it into a playlist with &ldquo;Lush&rdquo; from Four Tet&rsquo;s &ldquo;New Energy&rdquo; album and the original version of &ldquo;I Will Make Room For You.&rdquo;
Enjoy!</p>

        <p>Nov. 11, 2017</p>
        <p>After I read &ldquo;Hello America&rdquo; and &ldquo;Like a Mule Bringing Ice Cream to the Sun&rdquo; to Ingrid, it was her turn to read something to me. We settled on Matt Haig&rsquo;s memoir of anxiety and depression &ldquo;Reasons to Stay Alive&rdquo;, which is as uplifting and life-affirming as its title suggests.
The book begins with its author standing atop some cliffs in Ibiza, crushed by depression and anxiety and determined to die.</p>

        <p>Nov. 5, 2017</p>
        <p>We cook this version of bolognaise with beetroot due to Ingrid&rsquo;s tomato allergy. This recipe is an attempt to capture what we do on the fly. The key to it is using the wine, the Worcestershire sauce and the herbs to even out the sweetness of the beetroot. If you can manage that, it&rsquo;s super tasty. The sauce usually ends up being an unusual but pleasing pink/purple colour, as you will see from the pictures.</p>

        <p>Nov. 4, 2017</p>
        <p>I had to compute an indicator this week. It had confidence intervals that relied on taking 100,000 samples from the indicator&rsquo;s approximate distribution. I had to repeat this over multiple GP practices and for twelve different demographic groups.
I decided to use dplyr1 because I thought it would help me organise all subgroups involved. I used mutate_at() heavily and thought that dplyr was keeping everything organised. However, when I moved from the 10 samples I&rsquo;d used for testing to the 100,000 samples required by the specification of the indicator, my code moved to a crawl.</p>

        <p>Nov. 3, 2017</p>
        <p>In recent weeks I have worn a suit to work. I bought a new furry woolly suit a few weeks ago and have alternated between it and my old one. I also bought new shoes that gave me blisters and made me cry. Enough time has passed that by now it feels natural rather than silly and those shoes don&rsquo;t eat my feet as much as they used to.
I think I feel calmer before I go to work as a result of wearing the suit.</p>

        <p>Oct. 31, 2017</p>
        <p>Three years ago today I moved in to my little flat in Chichester, soon to start a new job. I had no money left but at least, after a character building stint of six months sleeping on the floor, I had a bed. In the intervening three years, my job role has expanded, I&rsquo;ve done another degree, the flat has become a home, and I&rsquo;ve met and married Ingrid. Add to that the fact that it&rsquo;s almost four years since I left for South America and I start to realise that I&rsquo;ve done a crazy amount of things in that time.</p>

        <p>Mary Epworth &ldquo;Elytral&rdquo; This album came to my attention because its lead single &ldquo;Me Swimming&rdquo; appeared on my Discover Weekly playlist. I&rsquo;d never heard of Mary before but this album was one of those nice discoveries that one sometimes makes when one tries to broaden what one listens to. The aforementioned &ldquo;Me Swimming&rdquo; is probably the best track, a beautiful slice of summery experimental pop layered over a beat that you can imagine as the kicks of a swimmer compared to the swirling lyric that imitates the pull of the strokes through the water.</p>

        <p>Oct. 30, 2017</p>
        <p>&ldquo;Like a Mule Bringing Ice Cream to the Sun&rdquo; is a novella by Sarah Ladipo Manyika. Of all the books nominated for the 2016 Goldsmiths Prize, this looked like the most interesting to my eyes. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed previous Goldsmiths nominated novels including Acts of the Assassins and Satin Island.
The title comes from a poem by Mary Ruefle called &ldquo;Donkey On&rdquo;. You can read it here.
&ldquo;Like a Mule&hellip;&rdquo; is set in contemporary San Francisco and takes the form of multiple first person narratives, centred around Dr.</p>

        <p>Oct. 29, 2017</p>
        <p>Perhaps in today&rsquo;s modern age of streaming and such, The Coral would be a bigger band and may have survived their eventual burnout. Their work ethic was evident from the start, as rumours swirled in the NME about a fantastic new band from Liverpool who were going to blow everybody&rsquo;s socks off. I went to see them live in Bristol after they&rsquo;d released three EPs and they were incredible. Their sound, a bit like the movie &ldquo;Holy Mountain&rdquo; set to pop music, imagined a Merseybeat channelled from an alternative universe in which Lennon and McCartney took their acid in the Mojave desert rather than in the English suburbs.</p>
