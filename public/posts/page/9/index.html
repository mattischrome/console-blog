        <p>Dec. 27, 2017</p>
        <p><h2 id="bjork-utopia">Bjork <em>Utopia</em></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Utopia&rdquo; is Björk&rsquo;s ninth album. It&rsquo;s a happier album compared to the emotional wreckage of &ldquo;Vulnicura&rdquo;. But while &ldquo;Vulnicura&rdquo; was a compelling if uncomfortable listen, &ldquo;Utopia&rdquo; is more comfortable and, unfortunately, not that compelling. This is old ground retrodden with few glimmers of past glories.</p>
<p>The brevity, succinctness and sharpness are all gone. Even on the best songs (the first three), there is very little strength in the lyrics. The music is all texture and no melody. And while formlessness and adaptability are central to the album&rsquo;s lyrical themes, the songs themselves are ill-served by allowing these same concepts to take hold of their arrangements.</p></p>

        <p>Dec. 26, 2017</p>
        <p><p>Here&rsquo;s a recipe to use up your turkey leftovers after Christmas.</p>
<p>You will need a slow cooker or an oven-proof cooking dish.</p>
<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>About four portions of cold turkey, torn into bite-sized pieces</li>
<li>1 sweet potato, chopped into small slivers</li>
<li>1 carrot, chopped into small slivers</li>
<li>1 onion, diced</li>
<li>2 cloves of garlic, diced</li>
<li>2 tsp mixed herbs</li>
<li>2 tsp smoked paprika</li>
<li>20g butter</li>
<li>50g diced chorizo</li>
<li>1 chicken stock cube mixed in about 700ml water (see method)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="method">Method</h2>
<ol>
<li>Melt the butter and fry the onions on a medium heat until golden.</li>
<li>Add the garlic and fry this mixture for a further thirty seconds.</li>
<li>Add the diced chorizo and continue to fry, adding a little stock and turning down the heat if things get a little too sticky.</li>
<li>Fold in the cold turkey and mix into the onions, garlic and chorizo.</li>
<li>Add half of the stock and bring to the boil.</li>
<li>Add the carrots, the sweet potato and the remainder of the stock.</li>
<li>Transfer to a slow cooker or the oven proof dish. If you&rsquo;re using a slow cooker, you need to make sure liquid covers the contents of the pot.</li>
<li>Use the default high setting of your slow cooker, or cook in the oven at 160C for about two hours.</li>
<li>Check on the pot when about 30 minutes of cooking time remains. If you need to thicken the mixture, stir about a tablespoon of cornflour into about 20ml of water and then add this to the pot, stirring it in well.</li>
<li>Serve with rice and a green vegetable.</li>
</ol></p>

        <p><p><a href="iceland-part-two">We left Gulfoss</a> and drove through the countryside to Fluðir where our next hotel stay would be. The hotel had cute little cabins arranged around a central square and the room itself was comfy and warm. Our dinner was nice enough, although we had a bit of a Fawlty Towers moment with Ingrid’s chicken salad. First it went back because they didn’t leave the BBQ sauce off. Then it came back <em>with</em> tomatoes. And then back again with more BBQ sauce. Fourth time lucky.</p></p>

        <p>Nov. 11, 2017</p>
        <p><p>After I read <a href="hello-america">&ldquo;Hello America&rdquo;</a> and <a href="like-a-mule-ice-cream-sun-manyika">&ldquo;Like a Mule Bringing Ice Cream to the Sun&rdquo;</a> to Ingrid, it was her turn to read something to me. We settled on <a href="http://www.matthaig.com/reasons-to-stay-alive/">Matt Haig&rsquo;s memoir of anxiety and depression &ldquo;Reasons to Stay Alive&rdquo;</a>, which is as uplifting and life-affirming as its title suggests.</p>
<p>The book begins with its author standing atop some cliffs in Ibiza, crushed by depression and anxiety and determined to die. Fortunately he doesn&rsquo;t go through with it and eventually this book detailing his experiences of recovery came out of it. It&rsquo;s an honest warts-and-all account of what it&rsquo;s like to be a depressed person and, perhaps even more crucially, what it&rsquo;s like to live with a depressed person.</p></p>

        <p>Nov. 5, 2017</p>
        <p><p>We cook this version of bolognaise with beetroot due to Ingrid&rsquo;s tomato allergy. This recipe is an attempt to capture what we do on the fly. The key to it is using the wine, the Worcestershire sauce and the herbs to even out the sweetness of the beetroot. If you can manage that, it&rsquo;s super tasty. The sauce usually ends up being an unusual but pleasing pink/purple colour, as you will see from the pictures.</p></p>

        <p>Nov. 4, 2017</p>
        <p><p>I had to compute an indicator this week. It had confidence intervals that relied on taking 100,000 samples from the indicator&rsquo;s approximate distribution. I had to repeat this over multiple GP practices and for twelve different demographic groups.</p>
<p>I decided to use <code>dplyr</code><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> because I thought it would help me organise all subgroups involved. I used <a href="http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise_all.html"><code>mutate_at()</code></a> heavily and thought that <code>dplyr</code> was keeping everything organised. However, when I moved from the 10 samples I&rsquo;d used for testing to the 100,000 samples required by the specification of the indicator, my code moved to a crawl. Fearing that my work laptop was a little puny, I left it running overnight on my Mac<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> and by morning R was still holding up its infuriating little stop sign.</p></p>

        <p>Nov. 3, 2017</p>
        <p><p>In recent weeks I have worn a suit to work. I bought a new furry woolly suit a few weeks ago and have alternated between it and my old one. I also bought new shoes that gave me blisters and made me cry. Enough time has passed that by now it feels natural rather than silly and those shoes don&rsquo;t eat my feet as much as they used to.</p>
<p>I think I feel calmer before I go to work as a result of wearing the suit. Suits are very little fuss. Pick the suit, pick the tie, job done. Besides, a suit flatters a man of my age and inclination towards biscuits. And finally my tie collection gets to see the light of day!</p></p>

        <p>Oct. 31, 2017</p>
        <p><p>Three years ago today I moved in to my little flat in Chichester, soon to start a new job. I had no money left but at least, after a character building stint of six months sleeping on the floor, I had a bed. In the intervening three years, my job role has expanded, I&rsquo;ve done another degree, the flat has become a home, and I&rsquo;ve met and married Ingrid. Add to that the fact that it&rsquo;s almost four years since I left for South America and I start to realise that I&rsquo;ve done a crazy amount of things in that time. I don&rsquo;t intend to stop.</p></p>

        <p><h2 id="mary-epworth-elytral">Mary Epworth &ldquo;Elytral&rdquo;</h2>
<p>This album came to my attention because its lead single &ldquo;Me Swimming&rdquo; appeared on my Discover Weekly playlist. I&rsquo;d never heard of Mary before but this album was one of those nice discoveries that one sometimes makes when one tries to broaden what one listens to. The aforementioned &ldquo;Me Swimming&rdquo; is probably the best track, a beautiful slice of summery experimental pop layered over a beat that you can imagine as the kicks of a swimmer compared to the swirling lyric that imitates the pull of the strokes through the water. Or the other way round. I was a latecomer to swimming, I&rsquo;m not very good at it. But I do know a good song when I hear one.</p></p>

        <p>Oct. 30, 2017</p>
        <p><p>&ldquo;Like a Mule Bringing Ice Cream to the Sun&rdquo; is a novella by <a href="http://www.sarahladipomanyika.com">Sarah Ladipo Manyika</a>. Of all the books nominated for the 2016 Goldsmiths Prize, this looked like the most interesting to my eyes. I&rsquo;ve enjoyed previous Goldsmiths nominated novels including <a href="acts-of-the-assassins-richard-beard">Acts of the Assassins</a> and <a href="satin-island-tom-mccarthy-review">Satin Island</a>.</p>
<p>The title comes from a poem by <a href="https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/mary-ruefle">Mary Ruefle</a> called &ldquo;Donkey On&rdquo;. You can read it <a href="http://thegreatnothingof1987.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/donkey-on-by-mary-ruefle.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a Mule&hellip;&rdquo; is set in contemporary San Francisco and takes the form of multiple first person narratives, centred around Dr. Morayo da Silva, an elderly Nigerian woman who is approaching her 75th birthday. The novel explores old age, memory, and how we use those things as a filter through which we perceive ourselves and others.</p></p>
