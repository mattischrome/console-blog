<h1>Album Digest, June 2016</h1>
<p>Jun. 30, 2016</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>Album Digest June 2016 is a poppy batch of albums. We have the return of my long-time favourites Roxette and the heroes of my South American tour Tegan &amp; Sara. There&rsquo;s some dance music in the form of Flume&rsquo;s album &ldquo;Skin&rdquo;: an Australian presence ahead of the new Avalanches album next month. Finally there is the first of two new albums by Islands - both were released back in May but one gets reviewed this month and the other next month.</p>
<h2 id="roxette-good-karma">Roxette &ldquo;Good Karma&rdquo;</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve loved <a href="http://www.roxette.se">Roxette</a> since I was about ten years old. The first album I ever owned was &ldquo;Look Sharp!&rdquo; (<a href="/uc12/">Understated Classic #12</a>) and although my interest waxes and wanes, I usually check in on them when they release new stuff.</p>
<p>This album is pretty much what you&rsquo;d expect from a pop band that&rsquo;s been going for over thirty years - they&rsquo;re having fun and they want you to have fun. It&rsquo;s nowhere near as good as their best stuff, but Marie can&rsquo;t sing as much as she used to due to previous health problems. When she does contribute it lifts everything, although in some places it sounds like she&rsquo;s been sampled off old records. Whether or not this is really the case I don&rsquo;t know, but it would be typically self-referential if they were. Whatever the circumstances there aren&rsquo;t many songs here that you&rsquo;d put on the next nostalgic hits compilation they release.</p>
<p>Nevertheless they are still game and they&rsquo;ve at least made an attempt to be current. None of the songs are guitar based and they&rsquo;re all very studio-centric. Sometimes they pull off some of the old magic by sheer force of will, as on opener &ldquo;Why Dontcha&rdquo; and the rollicking &ldquo;20BPM&rdquo;. At other points sentiment wins the day, like on &ldquo;Some Other Summer&rdquo; (a conciliatory song about teenage heartbreak) and &ldquo;Why Don&rsquo;t You Bring Me Flowers?&rdquo; (in which Marie offers to buy you sweater, one as soft as moonlight). Unfortunately you get the odd bit of naff &ldquo;old geezers do naff R&amp;B&rdquo; as well, like on the verses of &ldquo;You Make It Sound So Simple&rdquo;, but at least they&rsquo;re still trying.</p>
<p>Overall it&rsquo;s nice that Roxette continue to make new music but &ldquo;Good Karma&rdquo; is not that essential to your world, unless you want a few new tracks to freshen up your mega playlist on Spotify. I&rsquo;d recommend &ldquo;It Just Happens&rdquo;, &ldquo;Why Don&rsquo;t You Bring Me Flowers?&rdquo;, &ldquo;20 BPM&rdquo;, and &ldquo;April Flowers&rdquo;. As Marie sings on that last track: &ldquo;I wish you all the best&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="tegan--sara-love-you-to-death">Tegan &amp; Sara &ldquo;Love You To Death&rdquo;</h2>
<p><a href="http://teganandsara.com">Tegan &amp; Sara&rsquo;s</a> last album &ldquo;Heartthrob&rdquo; ended up as one of my favourite albums of 2014. Though it was released in 2013, I didn&rsquo;t buy until I was in Argentina in 2014. I discovered it when I began to play &ldquo;Closer&rdquo; loads on my iPad Nano. I ended up playing &ldquo;Heartthrob&rdquo; to death on the truck during the rest of the tour, there was something about it that got to the heart of my quest for reinvention. I think when I left for South America, I didn&rsquo;t really know if I was going to change who I was, or whether or not I needed to, but after a few listens of &ldquo;Closer&rdquo; I understood that I did and that I was.</p>
<p>When you have a strong emotional connection to a particular album, it can be difficult to build a similar connection to that artist&rsquo;s later material. I think that is the case for me with &ldquo;Love You To Death&rdquo;. It has the same structure as &ldquo;Closer&rdquo;: ten immaculate pop songs last well under forty minutes. Every song is precise and clever, not outstaying its welcome and contributing to a sugar rush of the kind that only the best pop music can provide. Just as with &ldquo;Closer&rdquo; there are three or four outstanding songs. By this I mean songs that you could consider to be classics, that you could put into books about pop songwriting as examplars of the genre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boyfriend&rdquo; plays out the illicit side of a love triangle and is a thrilling rush of sexy innuendo and desire. &ldquo;100x&rdquo; delivers heartbreak and devastation at the end of a relationship in a mature yet soul-destroying way, one of those rare songs that is lovely despite its emotional charge rather because of it. &ldquo;Stop Desire&rdquo; is about as horny as a song can get before becoming so overt that it bores, it&rsquo;s exciting and titilating rather than lascivious or crude.</p>
<p>The other songs are fun too, I especially like how &ldquo;BWU&rdquo; playfully pokes fun at gay marriage (&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need a white wedding&rdquo;). It&rsquo;s empowering music that embraces all sexualities and orientations whilst being overtly and cheerfully queer. It&rsquo;s wonderful.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see where Tegan &amp; Sara go next. Repeating &ldquo;Closer&rdquo; was OK because it was such a great album and managing to produce such a close companion with &ldquo;Love You To Death&rdquo; is no mean feat. It&rsquo;s clear that they are among the best pop song writers around at the moment and hopefully they can step forward again next time out.</p>
<h2 id="flume-skin">Flume &ldquo;Skin&rdquo;</h2>
<p>As far as I&rsquo;m aware this is <a href="http://www.flumemusic.com">Flume&rsquo;s</a> second album. I added his self-titled debut album to my Spotify back when it was released but I never managed to find the time to listen to it. I think I will go back to it after hearing &ldquo;Skin&rdquo;, an album that&rsquo;s not perfect but does have some interesting ideas.</p>
<p>The problem with &ldquo;Skin&rdquo; is that it is a bit patchy. There&rsquo;s no real plan, so it feels like an uneven listen. Individual songs are great but as I listened to the entirety of the album I felt like I might enjoy the songs more as part of a playlist or mix alongside other artists&rsquo; songs.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no denying that Flume is a talented artist. He manages to make a track featuring Busta Rhymes sound interesting, something I&rsquo;d&rsquo;ve thought wasn&rsquo;t possible. On the other hand the album features six different female vocalists but you&rsquo;d be hard pressed to tell each of their songs from any of the others (A possible exception is Little Dragon, because I know their work and the voice of their singer).</p>
<p>The most interesting tracks are the instrumental vignettes. In particular &ldquo;Wall Fuck&rdquo;, &ldquo;3&rdquo;, &ldquo;Pika&rdquo; and &ldquo;Free&rdquo; are all really good. &ldquo;Pika&rdquo; sounds like Battles, which is always get a track into my good books. Elsewhere there&rsquo;s a collaboration with Beck, which sounds exciting but it&rsquo;s more of &ldquo;Morning Phase&rdquo; or &ldquo;Modern Guilt&rdquo; kind of Beck that shows up, when you desperately want it to be an &ldquo;Odelay&rdquo; kind of Beck just to pick things up a bit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Skin&rdquo; is good album rather than a great one. I can hear the potential for a great album within these tracks but there&rsquo;s also a frustrating lack of direction at some points. I wonder if Flume can direct his talents toward something more cohesive next time and, dare I say it, a little more fun? (Also, I wonder what that first album sounds like?&hellip;)</p>
<h2 id="islands-should-i-remain-here-at-sea">Islands &ldquo;Should I Remain Here At Sea?&rdquo;</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have much to say about the new <a href="http://islandsareforever.com">Islands</a> album &ldquo;Should I Remain Here At Sea?&rdquo; at the moment, save to say that I&rsquo;ve listened to it through a couple of times and enjoyed it. It&rsquo;s one of two albums recently released by the band. <a href="http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/islands">Both were crowdfunded</a>. This one is meant to be a sequel in spirit to their debut &ldquo;Return To Sea&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s very straightforward and rocky. I&rsquo;ll be reviewing the other album &ldquo;Taste&rdquo; next month. It&rsquo;s meant to be more electronic but I haven&rsquo;t listened to it all yet.</p>
<p>I remember &ldquo;Return To Sea&rdquo; as being more tricky and complex than anything on &ldquo;Shall I Remain Here At Sea?&rdquo;. A case in point is the opening track on each album. &ldquo;Return To Sea&rdquo; begins with &ldquo;Swans&rdquo;, which stretches over nine and a half minutes while twisting and turning over itself multiple times. &ldquo;Shall I Remain Here At Sea?&rdquo; begins with a three minute song called &ldquo;Back Into It&rdquo; that does pretty much what it says on the tin: it reintroduces you to a more straightforward version of the Islands sound in order to get you back into it.</p>
<p>The songs on &ldquo;Shall I Remain Here At Sea?&rdquo; don&rsquo;t deviate too far from that template. They don&rsquo;t have any titles as strange and funny as &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Call Me Whitney, Bobby&rdquo; but the songs are as poppy and fun as that one. I can hear the similarities between &ldquo;Return To Sea&rdquo; and this album, though nostalgia may drive me back to the parent over the child. Nevertheless, there is also some sweet and simple stuff that I wasn&rsquo;t expecting. &ldquo;Sun Conure&rdquo; is a very cute little song that would be an ideal accompaniment to a caipirinha at sunset on a Brazilian beach.</p>
<p>I look forward to listening to &ldquo;Taste&rdquo; as well and I hope I will write more about both albums in next month&rsquo;s album digest.</p>
