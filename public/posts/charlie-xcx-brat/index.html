<h1>Charlie XCX, Brat</h1>
<p>Jan. 30, 2025</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>When making my albums of the year posts at the start of the month, I realised that compared to many other critics lists, there was no sign of <em>Brat</em> by Charlie XCX. And when it came up again on my album shuffle the other day, I  thought I should re-evaluate the album and whether it should have made my list.</p>
<p>Listening to <em>Brat</em> again for this post, it was clear that I&rsquo;d missed out on something special. This was partly because I went for a walk with it on my headphones and that always lets me hear the details of the music. I think too many times when this album came on at home, it would be a little bit too doof-doof to be background music. These are songs that do demand (and deserve) a bit of attention.</p>
<p><img src="./images/charlie_xcx_brat.jpg" alt="Cover of Brat by Charlie XCX"></p>
<p>However, I can see why the album as a whole didn&rsquo;t make a huge impression on me, and why it got skipped over a fair bit last year. The songs are pretty samey, both in content and style. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, lots of albums have the distinguishing feature that one track only differs from another due to a slightly different production quirk. Lots of those albums are great. <em>Brat</em> is great too, but&hellip;</p>
<p>The hyperpop production style is too hyperactive for me. I appreciate the beats and the energy, but it&rsquo;s so flat as to be hard to stomach after a while. That flatness is what makes the little twists in production stand out, like the flashes of colour on a Mondrian grid. For instance, the way the autotune slips out from under the vocal on <em>Sympathy is a Knife</em>: though that&rsquo;s one of the more interesting songs anyway, the trick isn&rsquo;t really needed.</p>
<p>The way that songs and ideas come thick and fast is praise-worthy though, stuff that&rsquo;s more experimental (like <em>I might some something stupid</em>) doesn&rsquo;t get bogged down with a long run time. The longest tracks are both 3:23 - with <em>Everything is romantic</em> probably being my favourite at the moment. It reminds me of the lyrics I used to write when I was 15 (albeit less worldly and way more cringe) but had no idea how to turn into songs. And that&rsquo;s what does excite me about <em>Brat</em>, it does seem to have novelty and experimentation at its heart.</p>
<p>So I do think it&rsquo;s good. I could totally understand someone saying they thought it was one of last year&rsquo;s best. I think someone saying that might not have to nudge <a href="https://mattischrome.com/posts/2024-albums-06-total-blue/">Total Blue</a>, <a href="https://mattischrome.com/posts/2024-albums-04-adrianne-lenker-bright-future/">Adrianne Lenker</a>, or <a href="https://mattischrome.com/posts/2024-albums-02-waxahatchee-tigers-blood/">Waxahatchee</a> off their lists. On the other hand, I can point to albums like <a href="https://mattischrome.com/posts/2024-albums-01-bolis-pupul-letter-to-yu/">Bolis Pupul&rsquo;s <em>Letter to Yu</em></a> and <a href="https://mattischrome.com/posts/2024-albums-05-il-quadro-di-troisi-la-commedia/">Il Quadro di Troisi&rsquo;s <em>La Commedia</em></a> as being my more pretentious old man versions of the same pick. Also that cover is amazing and I will love it forever.</p>
