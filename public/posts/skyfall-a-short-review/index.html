<h1>Skyfall: A Short Review</h1>
<p>Nov. 3, 2012</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>I went to see &ldquo;Skyfall&rdquo; last night and I really enjoyed it. I knew nothing about the plot, mostly because I had avoided all discussion of the plot with people who had already seen it and I even avoided reviews as so many these days seem to just rattle off plot points, instead of discussing what makes the movie any good. With that in mind I will obviously try not to give away any of the plot in this brief review.</p>
<p>I think &ldquo;Skyfall&rdquo; is probably the most enjoyable Bond movie that I have seen. It takes a lot of the now familiar formula - starting <em>in medias res</em>, lavish animated intro (Adele&rsquo;s theme song is stunning), a completely unhinged villain - and manages to produce a solid and entertaining film.</p>
<p>In one of it&rsquo;s blogs this week the Guardian asked whether Bond had become too grim and serious. I&rsquo;d say that Skyfall does have a more mournful tone but there are hints of light and brightness too. There were plenty of moments where the whole cinema laughed as one. I think the days of Roger Moore&rsquo;s arched eyebrows are over, as are lazy characterisations of slapstick American sherrifs who are fat and short-tempered. I am glad that &ldquo;Skyfall&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t a po-mo- deconstruction of who or what Bond should represent in the twenty-first century, I like that there is some suspension of belief.</p>
<p>Nevertheless it is a modern Bond film and I think it shows most in the cinematography. There were scenes that just looked wonderfully beautiful and bonkers at the same time. They reminded me of scenes from &ldquo;Enter The Void&rdquo; and I think it is great that a populist vehicle such as a Bond movie is being used to introduce people to wonderful cinematography. I realised a few scenes later that it is a large part of Bond&rsquo;s popularity, that each Bond movie is partly a reflection of our times. For fifty years the Bond movie has been a sort of travelogue introducing (or re-introducing) us to parts of the world.</p>
<p>I thought the acting was excellent and to my eyes Daniel Craig is fast becoming the definitive Bond. Javier Bardem&rsquo;s turn as the scenery-chewing baddie is really something to behold, though his performance feels a bit wasted in this plot and it might have been better for him to play someone intent on blowing up the moon or something. It&rsquo;s always good to see Ben Whishaw in anything but he&rsquo;s underused and I&rsquo;ve already been spoiled by his stunning performance as Richard II in &ldquo;The Hollow Crown&rdquo; on the BBC earlier this year.</p>
