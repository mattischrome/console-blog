    <p>Note: Recent months have been very busy, so this album digest combines a review of the new album by The National with a couple of reviews left over from earlier in the year.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve written a few more album reviews in the past months but I&rsquo;m so far behind (February and March have already been published on a considerable lag) that I&rsquo;m just going to pepper forthcoming digests with additional reviews of older albums.</p>
<h2 id="the-national-sleep-well-beast">The National &ldquo;Sleep Well Beast&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The National are one of my favourite bands. Up until this album, they would release a great album every two years. However four years have passed since 2013&rsquo;s &ldquo;Trouble Will Find Me&rdquo;. Not that you would know it from the opening pair of &ldquo;Nobody Else Will Be There&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Day I Die&rdquo;. The first is a slow burner, creeping in like &ldquo;Terrible Love&rdquo; on &ldquo;High Violet&rdquo; but without that song&rsquo;s eventual pyrotechnics. It&rsquo;s a song about wanting to get to a party early so that you can leave the party early. It seems as though The National have aged in the same way I have. On the other hand, &ldquo;The Day I Die&rdquo; is about as poppy as they&rsquo;ve ever deigned to be. It&rsquo;s a simple and catchy song, and, as it it turns out, it&rsquo;s a palette cleanser for the more experimental fare to follow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walk It Back&rdquo; stretches three song fragments over six minutes. A twitchy riff and a detached vocal line (mostly just the title) dominate the opening minutes, before a spoken word and found footage collage takes over. The track closes with a beautiful instrumental interlude with another of The National&rsquo;s highly underrated string arrangements. &ldquo;Walk It Back&rdquo; also manages to bleed into lead single &ldquo;The System Only Dreams In Total Darkness&rdquo; without too much fuss. It&rsquo;s a mid-tempo song that descends into squally guitar riffs, it sounds National-like but without being cliché. You can say the same for &ldquo;Born To Beg&rdquo; in which a languid vocal lolls over an insistent yet delicate beat but in keeping with their new sound, it also gets a bit fuzzy in the middle.</p>
<p>Next up is &ldquo;Turtleneck&rdquo; which is the most raucous song The National have produced since &ldquo;Mr November&rdquo;.<label for="sidenote-ef54218541c8cdec60586210d02a676a-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sidenote-ef54218541c8cdec60586210d02a676a-0" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">Mr November is the first song I ever heard by The National. I was in Moles nightclub in Bath and I even went up to the DJ to ask what the song was. I bought a copy of &ldquo;Alligator&rdquo; that weekend and was hooked.</span> That song was about the disillusionment the band felt at the re-election of George W. Bush in 2004. You can guess who this one&rsquo;s about. It&rsquo;s a song of bitter disappointment rather than anger, full of pithy lines about politicians.</p>
<p>Following this there are three more beat-driven tracks. &ldquo;Empire Line&rdquo; is one of those songs that The National write effortlessly, a sort of cross between &ldquo;Green Gloves&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fake Empire&rdquo;. It even has a touch of auto tune. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll Still Destroy You&rdquo; is the best song on the album, with another drawn out ending like &ldquo;Walk It Back&rdquo; but this time with a clatter of drums and an epic string arrangement that somehow manages to cut through in between, like shafts of sunlight through clouds or overhead lights on the motorway. &ldquo;Guilty Party&rdquo; features perhaps the glitchiest musical backdrop and a lyric that reminds me of &ldquo;Pink Rabbits&rdquo; from &ldquo;Trouble Will Find Me&rdquo;. It also reminds me of when I saw them live in 2007 and they did &ldquo;About Today&rdquo; (one my favourite songs ever), expanding it to over eight minutes with a crazy  drummer jam at the end of the lyric. I love how The National&rsquo;s amazing rhythm section makes tracks like these seem completely effortless.</p>
<p>Afterwards there are two slightly more straightforward songs, &ldquo;Carin at the Liquor Store&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Dark Side of the Gym&rdquo;. The former is another &ldquo;Pink Rabbits&rdquo; style ballad full of self-deprecation and word games. The latter initially sounds a bit like the opening of &ldquo;Dark Side of the Moon&rdquo; but it turns out that the title does indeed come out of the content of the lyrics - &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna keep you in love with me&hellip; for a while&hellip;&rdquo;. Once again, they deliver a completely new and modern kind of love song in the vein of &ldquo;Mistaken For Strangers&rdquo; or &ldquo;Karen&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The last track is the title track, which for me is the only disappointment. Another twitchy track that resembles &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll Still Destroy You&rdquo; but doesn&rsquo;t quite work for me. Perhaps it will given a bit more time. Tucked away as it is right at the end of the album, I haven&rsquo;t given it too much consideration so far. At the moment, it just feels like a weird bonus track or remix. Nevertheless &ldquo;Sleep Well Beast&rdquo; (the album) is well worth a listen and is full of songs that will sit well in any playlist of great songs by this band.</p>
<h2 id="nelly-furtado-the-ride">Nelly Furtado &ldquo;The Ride&rdquo;</h2>
<p>This new album from Nelly Furtado follows on from &ldquo;The Spirit Indestructible&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mi Plan&rdquo;, both of which I liked. I noted in <a href="album-digest-september-2012">my review of <em>The Spirit Indestructible</em></a> that it was all over the shop. The only version of it on Spotify now is the deluxe edition, a hot mess that confuses quantity for quality. <a href="https://mattischrome.com/album-digest-january-2013/"><em>Mi Plan</em> was a nice tack back to &lsquo;proper&rsquo; song writing</a> but it wasn&rsquo;t successful enough to warrant a sustained change of direction.</p>
<p>I am a big fan of Nelly Furtado and her music. I think that &ldquo;Whoah Nelly!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Folklore&rdquo; are both really great albums, choosing the latter as <a href="uc20">an understated classic</a>. Each album differs a little from the last so she seems to grow with each step. She&rsquo;s also been judicious with her choice of collaborators. These have been distinctive enough for her to raise her game without overwhelming her identity. &ldquo;The Ride&rdquo; is self-released and features no collaborators save for a new producer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Congleton">John Congleton</a>, who has worked on albums by St. Vincent and Goldfrapp among many others.</p>
<p>I first listened to &ldquo;The Ride&rdquo; on headphones and hated it. The new production style is hostile to headphone listening. I found this a surprise because so much music is now geared toward headphone listening. Moreover, given that this album is meant to be a return to more personal song writing it seems silly to make it so awful to listen to on headphones. If you&rsquo;re aiming for intimacy and feeling, why layer the songs in such gimmicky and prickly production?<label for="sidenote-ef54218541c8cdec60586210d02a676a-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sidenote-ef54218541c8cdec60586210d02a676a-1" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">The same approach was successful for St. Vincent on her self-titled album precisely because she was singing about the alienating experiences of our increasingly digital lifestyles.</span></p>
<p>So the best thing about &ldquo;The Ride&rdquo; (and it&rsquo;s not much of a win) is that it doesn&rsquo;t quite sound as awful out loud. However, the songs themselves indicate that this album may be one reinvention too many. If you want a Doctor Who reference - and who doesn&rsquo;t? - this is her Colin Baker album. It has moments where the material transcends the presentation and it&rsquo;s not so awful as to suggest that future incarnations will be as bad.</p>
<p>Take &ldquo;Cold Hard Truth&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pipe Dreams&rdquo; for example. These are objectively great songs. In fact the former wears the new production so well that maybe this was what convinced Nelly to run with it. It&rsquo;s punchy and marries well with its subject matter. &ldquo;Pipe Dreams&rdquo; echoes &ldquo;Explode&rdquo; from &ldquo;Folklore&rdquo;, telling the story from an older, more jaded, angle. Again the production doesn&rsquo;t wave around unnecessarily and there is also a wonderful spooky video to accompany the song on youtube.</p>
<p>The rest of the album is okay, provided you don&rsquo;t listen on headphones. The trouble is that none of it is going to set the world alight. That&rsquo;s a shame because she&rsquo;s been brave enough to self-release an album that <em>does</em> experiment and innovate. The problem is that some experiments do end in failure. This is one of those. The big question is what happens next? I hope she carries on regardless: grows a little, changes a bit and keeps on singing.</p>
<h2 id="goldfrapp-sliver-eye">Goldfrapp &ldquo;Sliver Eye&rdquo;</h2>
<p>From one album to another, Goldfrapp slalom between sleepy pastoral idylls and futuristic sexy techno pop. On &ldquo;Silver Eye&rdquo; they once again make this transition, opting for a noisy bravura sound following the gentle strings and croons of [2013&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tales of Us&rdquo;.](<a href="https://mattischrome.com/album-digest-september-2013/">https://mattischrome.com/album-digest-september-2013/</a> &ldquo;Album Digest September 2013, featuring a review of &ldquo;Tales of Us&rdquo; by Goldfrapp.&rdquo;) I said of the last album:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;if &ldquo;Tales of Us&rdquo; proves anything, it&rsquo;s that there will be no nicer place for Goldfrapp to graze out their dotage than on the foothills of Felt Mountain.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well as it happens there&rsquo;s plenty more glitter balls and white horses in the band yet. <em>Silver Eye</em> is a mostly sparkly and stompy return to form. Unlike the last uptempo Goldfrapp album &ldquo;Head First&rdquo; which played things pretty straight, this album contains some songs that are downright peculiar and it&rsquo;s all the better for it.</p>
<p>Lead single &ldquo;Anymore&rdquo; sticks to the template for Goldfrapp singles by songs like &ldquo;Number 1&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ooh La La&rdquo;, though there&rsquo;s something squelchy low in the mix that gradually overtakes the song as it progresses. Joe Goddard&rsquo;s remix on the 12&quot; is even better, it&rsquo;s very much the Dr. Hyde to the album version&rsquo;s Mr. Jekyll. On the album, the de facto title track &ldquo;Systemagic&rdquo; also succumbs to this transformation, it&rsquo;s a rollicking beast almost dripping with bass lines. It&rsquo;s a fissile song, one that&rsquo;s about ten seconds from corroding through your speakers. It&rsquo;s also insanely catchy, which always helps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tigerman&rdquo; returns to &ldquo;Felt Mountain&rdquo;-type material, channelling &ldquo;Lovely Head&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s also got these weird whooshy bits that seem to throw themselves around your speakers  and on headphones it produces a disorienting effect.</p>
<p>In a first for Goldfrapp, &ldquo;Become The One&rdquo; is almost entirely spoken word. The lyric has a Laurie Andersen feel but also reminds me a little bit of &ldquo;Happiness&rdquo; and &ldquo;Clowns&rdquo; from &ldquo;The Seventh Tree&rdquo;. This might be another track that responds well to remixes. &ldquo;Faux Suede Drifter&rdquo; pulses and drifts for five minutes, a weird little torch song. I love the way it picks up just after the three minute mark, it&rsquo;s very eighties - sounding a bit like the atmospheric bits of Whitney Houston&rsquo;s &ldquo;I Wanna Dance With You&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zodiac Black&rdquo; begins like a folk song, it could almost like a leftover from &ldquo;Tales of Us&rdquo; or a song that would have sat well on <a href="/posts/album-digest-march-2017/">JFDR&rsquo;s &ldquo;Brazil&rdquo; in March</a>. I really like the way that the atmospherics hiss behind the lyrics like misty moonlight. Unfortunately, while the song always feels like a moment of catharsis is coming, what ultimately arrives is disappointing. The song doesn&rsquo;t really go anywhere. This seems to be a problem with the majority of the tracks on &ldquo;Silver Tree&rdquo;: they&rsquo;re good but they don&rsquo;t really amount to much. In the end songs like &ldquo;Moon in Your Mouth&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ocean&rdquo; and the others already discussed sound like the more forgettable tracks that will be scraped for another greatest hits comp in a few years&rsquo; time. I really wanted to like this album, but in the final analysis it&rsquo;s good but not great.</p>
