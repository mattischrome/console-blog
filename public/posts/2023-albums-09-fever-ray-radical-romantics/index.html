    <p>Radical Romantics, the third album by Fever Ray was released in April. I bought a copy on red vinyl which is a beautiful sight to behold.<span class="marginfigure">

</span> I listened to a lot when it was released but eased up a bit until listening to it a couple more times while writing this list. It&rsquo;s a great collection of songs, probably better than their second album &ldquo;Plunge&rdquo;. The cover art is just as scary though.</p>
<p>The first track &ldquo;What They Call Us&rdquo; is a call to arms regarding identity and has a lyric that tapped into a lot of things I&rsquo;ve been thinking about identity and the ongoing culture war. I love how the art work for this album really challenges the standard notions of aesthetic beauty: it&rsquo;s full of demonic illustrations and gothic fonts. There&rsquo;s a lot of orange and red. It really suits the way Fever Ray also plays with their voice, pitching it down for the most part to play against pre-determined notions of gender, but occasionally also pitching up to create humour and childlike innocence.</p>
<p>Once you get around how their voice changes in and around and between the songs, their tenderness and calmness starts to creep up on you. I hadn&rsquo;t realised how much I&rsquo;d just <em>imported</em> &ldquo;Candy&rdquo; as a song, I just sing along every time it comes on. &ldquo;North&rdquo; is devastatingly beautiful and &ldquo;Tapping Fingers&rdquo; really homes in on a modern romance. In other places, romance gets conflated with the very business of being and living - perhaps that&rsquo;s the reason for the album&rsquo;s title - songs like &ldquo;Shiver&rdquo; and &ldquo;Looking for a Ghost&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t just about how scary relationships are, but also about just how scary life can be sometimes.</p>
<p>Many reviews have singled out &ldquo;Even It Out&rdquo; as being a bit against the grain with its lyric of &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no place for you / we&rsquo;re gonna even it out&rdquo; as a response to a bully of one of their children. But I like that song, it&rsquo;s saying that we can call out people for hurting us, we can stand in solidarity of the oppressed and even it out.</p>
<p>For me, the highlight of the whole album is &ldquo;Carbon Dioxide&rdquo;, even though I must have listened to it almost a hundred times I am still not sure what it&rsquo;s about. Part of the reason I like it is the glorious production, the whole song is a giddy jaunt from start to finish. It would sit awkwardly among all the love songs if it weren&rsquo;t so self assured. I think it could be a hymn to carbon dioxide, a sort of perverse celebration of the very thing that threatens the future of all humans. Or it could be a metaphor&hellip; I&rsquo;m still not sure.</p>
<p>As per all Fever Ray albums - based off three data points - the final track is an instrumental built on vocalisations. This is the track that is most reminiscent of The Knife&rsquo;s &ldquo;Shaking The Habitual&rdquo;, despite it not being one of the tracks that reunites Karin and Olof. And yes, I listened to &ldquo;Shaking The Habitual&rdquo; for the first time in <em>years</em> a few weeks and that album still sounds weird even now. &ldquo;Radical Romantics&rdquo; is not so odd, in fact it&rsquo;s a brilliant blend of the radical and the romantic that I will be listening to for years to come.</p>
