        <p>Jan. 2, 2025</p>
        <p><p>The first time I listened to this album, I was still off work sick with Covid, but well enough to go out for a walk on what was too hot a day to stay inside the house. I remember it well, recovering from illness does tend to make these things more vivid, but more because I thought it was brilliant, but all out of order. I was, of course, completely wrong.</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 1, 2025</p>
        <p><p>Yard Act are a post-punk band from Leeds. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s My Utopia?&rdquo; is their second album. I first encountered Yard Act in a review of this album, which sent me to look at the excellent video to their non-album single &ldquo;The Trenchcoat Museum&rdquo;. I enjoyed the metatextual references both in the video and the song, so I eagerly added &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s My Utopia?&rdquo; to my library.</p>
<p>However, the album took a while to win me over. Fourth-wall breaking asides and meta references are fine in a single song, even one as long as &ldquo;The Trenchcoat Museum&rdquo;, but combined over the length of a whole album, it can be a bit off-putting. Nevertheless, WMU? rewards repeat listens (especially on headphones) because it&rsquo;s genuinely funny - I think comedy is an underrated quality in Indie music - and the songs themselves are ace.</p></p>

        <p><p>A nice feature I added to this blog in its recent update was a <a href="https://mattischrome.com/tags/">tags page</a>. With the help of this <a href="https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/how-to-get-a-tags-page/24213/4">very useful discourse thread</a> and some additional CSS tweaks, the resulting page is something that I am very happy with. It lists all of the tags that apply to any post, along with the number of posts with that tag, in alphabetical order. It&rsquo;s mostly intended as a guide for you the reader, to help you see whether your preoccupations match my own.</p></p>

        <p>Aug. 6, 2024</p>
        <p><p>A hardback book called &ldquo;The Satsuma Complex&rdquo; is all that remains of a mysterious young lady that young lawyer Gary is chatting up in the pub one night. It&rsquo;s a book that everyone reckons is &ldquo;a bit sh*t&rdquo;. But Gary&rsquo;s moping about after the Satsuma lady doing a runner while he was in the loo will have to be put on hold when his friend turns up dead.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed this book. It&rsquo;s not going to win any prizes for quality of writing but it is both fun and funny. There are a few repetitive phrases and at one point beers magically become lagers in the space of three paragraphs. The writing is very colloquial but there is a point-of-view shift at the start of part two that deploys some writerly skill. (This short-lived though as the new point-of-view soon collapses down into one similar to the main character.)</p></p>
