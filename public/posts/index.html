        <p>Jan. 13, 2025</p>
        <p><p>In searching for something to write about today, I wondered whether I had ever written about Pilates on this blog before. I modified <a href="/posts/fun-with-chatgpt/">the search of my posts from yesterday&rsquo;s post</a> to look for the word Pilates<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and it only came up once in <a href="/posts/ambitions-revisited/">a post about revisiting my ambitions ten years on</a>.</p>
<p>There I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I haven’t taken up meditation at all because the inside of my head is way too noisy. What I did do (at Ingrid’s suggestion) is take up Pilates: I swear by it now. It’s not quite the same as meditation but I’ve found the improvements to my core strength to be quite useful for my mental health.&rdquo;</p></p>

<p>For my blog I have a folder called posts. In that folder are more folders that are named for the slug of each post, as per the conventions of the Hugo static site generator. Those folders each contain a markdown file named index.md, each of which has a YAML header. Draft posts have a YAML key called draft which has the value true. Please can you write me a shell script that I can run from the directory above posts that tells me which folders in the posts folder contain draft posts?</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 11, 2025</p>
        <p><p>2025 might be a tough year, but I am going to try and blog every day. It means that now and then I might be writing a post like this one, where I am writing for the sake of continuing the streak. If I find myself doing that too often then I will take the hint and stop trying!</p>
<p>This weekend was the 3rd round of the FA Cup, which is when the premier league and championship teams enter the competition. This is the first time for quite a few years where Portsmouth have entered at this stage. Naturally, they&rsquo;re already out! Mind you, in recent years when they&rsquo;ve entered at the first round they haven&rsquo;t made it past those rounds either. That was bad news for one pub in Portsmouth which always made a big show of not taking down their Christmas decorations until Pompey were out of the FA Cup!</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 10, 2025</p>
        <p><p><a href="https://bolispupul.bandcamp.com">Bolis Pupul</a> (the stage name of Boris Zeebroek) is an artist on <a href="https://deew.ee/catalogue">Soulwax&rsquo;s Deewee label</a>. <a href="https://deew.ee/catalogue/074">&ldquo;Letter to Yu&rdquo;</a> is his debut album, inspired by a trip to Hong Kong to investigate his family history. It investigates themes of place, family, and identity. We are exposed to everywhere all at once but we&rsquo;re also all <em>from</em> somewhere, even if it&rsquo;s somewhere we might not recommend or understand.</p>
<p>Aside from the theme of the album, it&rsquo;s a satisfying and varied electronic album. You have a pop song early on in &ldquo;Completely Half&rdquo; (&ldquo;I thought that I / would fit right in / I&rsquo;m on the border of the state I&rsquo;m in&rdquo;) but the rest of side one is fine electro, peaking with the frenetic &ldquo;Doctor Says&rdquo; and ebbing out with the ringing &ldquo;Spicy Crab&rdquo;. (I realised writing this that the vinyl omits &ldquo;Frogs&rdquo; from the streaming version, but this makes the vinyl version of the album better paced.)</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 9, 2025</p>
        <p><p>&ldquo;Tiger&rsquo;s Blood&rdquo; is a glorious bundle of songs that writhe with brains and heart, with love and friendship, and many other complements and opposites. The music is mostly alternative AOR with a distinct country twang. The lyrics were pretty impenetrable to me, at least until I looked them up online (and they&rsquo;re also on the back of the poster that came with the LP), but they&rsquo;re mostly songs of hope and happiness. It was satisfying to listen to an album this care-free, even if there is a hint of darker times in the background.</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 8, 2025</p>
        <p><p>Acopia are a band from Melbourne Australia with that time honoured line up of one girl and two guys. This eponymous album is their second and it&rsquo;s full of slinky electronic ballads that echo classic 90s trip hop. It&rsquo;s got that same downtempo downbeat vibe, the sorts of songs that revel in sadness but also the joy of a killer bass line.</p>
<p>This album was actually released in November 2023 but I first heard it in January 2024 after reading a glowing review of it. I can remember the first time listening to it, I took the train to see my parents in to hand over a present I&rsquo;d bought for my nephew. (Fittingly, it&rsquo;s his birthday today.)</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 7, 2025</p>
        <p><p>One album that&rsquo;s lurking in the periphery of my <a href="">understated classics series</a> is &ldquo;Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe In You&rdquo; by Big Thief. &ldquo;Bright Future&rdquo; is the latest solo album by Big Thief singer-songwriter Adrianne Lenker and it is just as good. Intimate and intricate, it draws the listener in as Adrianne sings live with a very small band. At times you can hear breaths drawn and the sound feels like a small space that you are cocooned in: this could be sound engineering (spatial audio would have us believe anything is possible) but it&rsquo;s most likely equipment set up intelligently in a cosy studio.</p></p>

        <p><p>It&rsquo;s interesting that an album sung entirely in Italian ended up being one of my favourites of the year, but perhaps not surprising given well written and arranged these songs are. They&rsquo;re just the right side of electro-pop but also with an air of sophistication.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t speak Italian but I do speak some romance languages, so I can sort of guess what the titles might mean. &ldquo;La Notte&rdquo; is &ldquo;The Night&rdquo;, &ldquo;Il Bucchi Neri&rdquo; is &ldquo;The Black Holes&rdquo; (I&rsquo;d thought it was the black mouths but I guess I was close!), and so on. As the for the lyrics, they&rsquo;re catching enough for me to sing a phonetic version of them to myself on many occasions, though I&rsquo;ve no idea what meaning I&rsquo;ve been mangling!</p></p>

        <p><p>What do you think of when you think of the colour blue? The sea? Perhaps the sky? Maybe it makes you think of blue stones like sapphires, or flowers such as forget-me-nots? Maybe the colour blue is the glow of a phone screen on someone&rsquo;s face (maybe yours) in the dark? Blue gathers at the edges of the harsh white LED light that has come to dominate our night time existence.</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 4, 2025</p>
        <p><p>I don&rsquo;t know very much about MGMT these days. I haven&rsquo;t read any interviews about their albums. The video to the single &ldquo;Nothing to Declare&rdquo; was brought to my attention by the YouTube channel Justin Hawkins Rides Again. In it he points out how melodically interesting the song is. To be honest I was more than a little bit in love with the video.</p>
<p>After that I added the album to my library and heard a few more singles in the run up to the release of the album, including &ldquo;Bubblegum Dog&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mother Nature&rdquo;. The album itself is crammed with similarly interesting songs and has a circular structure, beginning with part 2 of the title track. I&rsquo;d love to know what poem is being read or sampled or cut up on &ldquo;Loss of Life, Pt. 2&rdquo;. Other highlights include &ldquo;Phradie&rsquo;s Song&rdquo; and a song called &ldquo;Nothing Changes&rdquo; which goes a bot bonkers in the second half, completely undermining the title of the song!</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 3, 2025</p>
        <p><p>Nonetheless is the fifteenth album by the Pet Shop Boys. As seems to be a common theme with this top 10 so far, it&rsquo;s an album that initially underwhelmed me. Well, perhaps &ldquo;underwhelmed&rdquo; is a little unfair, it was more that it didn&rsquo;t seem to have much to it to distinguish it from their previous albums, and there have been some palpable duds in the previous fourteen.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, this album is definitely a grower. As I&rsquo;ve gotten to know some of the songs, I&rsquo;ve come to appreciate the little details strewn throughout. For example, the lovely little rave riff that breaks into the bridge on &ldquo;Loneliness&rdquo;, something that turns a potentially stern song into something a lot more fun.</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 2, 2025</p>
        <p><p>The first time I listened to this album, I was still off work sick with Covid, but well enough to go out for a walk on what was too hot a day to stay inside the house. I remember it well, recovering from illness does tend to make these things more vivid, but more because I thought it was brilliant, but all out of order. I was, of course, completely wrong.</p></p>
