        <p>Dec. 19, 2024</p>
        <p><p>Yard Act are a post-punk band from Leeds. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s My Utopia?&rdquo; is their second album. I first encountered Yard Act in a review of this album, which sent me to look at the excellent video to their non-album single &ldquo;The Trenchcoat Museum&rdquo;. I enjoyed the metatextual references both in the video and the song, so I eagerly added &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s My Utopia?&rdquo; to my library.</p>
<p>However, the album took a while to win me over. Fourth-wall breaking asides and meta references are fine in a single song, even one as long as &ldquo;The Trenchcoat Museum&rdquo;, but combined over the length of a whole album, it can be a bit off-putting. Nevertheless, WMU? rewards repeat listens (especially on headphones) because it&rsquo;s genuinely funny - I think comedy is an underrated quality in Indie music - and the songs themselves are ace.</p></p>

        <p>Oct. 26, 2024</p>
        <p><p>A nice feature I added to this blog in its recent update was a <a href="https://mattischrome.com/tags/">tags page</a>. With the help of this <a href="https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/how-to-get-a-tags-page/24213/4">very useful discourse thread</a> and some additional CSS tweaks, the resulting page is something that I am very happy with. It lists all of the tags that apply to any post, along with the number of posts with that tag, in alphabetical order. It&rsquo;s mostly intended as a guide for you the reader, to help you see whether your preoccupations match my own.</p></p>

        <p>Aug. 6, 2024</p>
        <p><p>A hardback book called &ldquo;The Satsuma Complex&rdquo; is all that remains of a mysterious young lady that young lawyer Gary is chatting up in the pub one night. It&rsquo;s a book that everyone reckons is &ldquo;a bit sh*t&rdquo;. But Gary&rsquo;s moping about after the Satsuma lady doing a runner while he was in the loo will have to be put on hold when his friend turns up dead.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed this book. It&rsquo;s not going to win any prizes for quality of writing but it is both fun and funny. There are a few repetitive phrases and at one point beers magically become lagers in the space of three paragraphs. The writing is very colloquial but there is a point-of-view shift at the start of part two that deploys some writerly skill. (This short-lived though as the new point-of-view soon collapses down into one similar to the main character.)</p></p>

        <p>Aug. 5, 2024</p>
        <p><p>Welcome to the new look for my blog. I&rsquo;ve had my eye on a more minimal look for a while now. Whether this new look is successful or not depends on how often I write new posts. To that end, this theme also supports a separate (or almost separate) stream of photos. Once I&rsquo;ve got back in to the habit of putting photos up, that should be a nice additional stream of content.</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 14, 2024</p>
        <p><p>Once upon a time, a cat named Nerys ripped into the bottom of our sofa to make herself a cozy burrow. This was all well and good, except for the times when she would do it when we were using the sofa too. On these occasions (and presumably on most others) she would proceed to sharpen her claws on what remained of the fabric. (A less charitable reason for this behaviour would be that she was simply widening the whole for her future self after eating more and more kibbles!)</p></p>

        <p><p>One of the things that people tend to start around this time of year is a diary. They usually get filled for as long as your new year&rsquo;s resolutions last.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;ve been writing in my current diary for a while. It&rsquo;s a Moleskine extra large ruled Notebook in beautiful Prussian Blue, covered in whatever stickers pass over my desk. (Hint: find my address and send me stickers Internet.) This is much more preferable to a &lsquo;real&rsquo; diary because I can leave a few days and then resume. I can also take breaks and write out a bunch of notes on Org-mode or the Julia programming language if I want to (and yes, I did).</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 11, 2024</p>
        <p><p>There was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/23998379/google-search-seo-algorithm-webpage-optimization">an excellent article on The Verge yesterday about how Google is transforming the kinds of sites and blogs that are on the internet</a>. I also read <a href="https://www.fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/where-have-all-the-websites-gone/">this slightly more personal take by Jason Velasquez</a>, which is more about how social networks have gobbled up all the time and attention of people who might otherwise be making interesting web sites. This has made me think deeply about what this blog is <em>for</em>, and why I might continue to blog in Twenty Twenty Four.</p></p>

        <p><p>When <a href="/2023-albums-07-maara-ancient-truth">I wrote about Maara&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Ancient Truth&rdquo;</a> over Christmas as part of my albums of the year rundown, I mentioned at the end that I would love to find a copy on vinyl to listen to. Well dear reader I managed to! It arrived today from the Netherlands with minimal fuss. It sounds great and I&rsquo;m not sure whether my review did it justice: that&rsquo;s the problem with attempting to (re-)review ten albums in ten days with Christmas and New Year all happening at the same time!</p></p>

        <p>Jan. 7, 2024</p>
        <p><p>Dear Future Matt,</p>
<ol>
<li>Always look up instructions for what you want to do in the Git documentation. It&rsquo;s dry but it&rsquo;s good. In a pinch, look at Stack Overflow. Don&rsquo;t ask Chat-GPT for advice on Git problems!</li>
<li>To reverse mistakes, consult the <a href="https://ohshitgit.com">Oh Shit Git</a> website.</li>
<li>To make things easier, delete the remote to your Github repository and then add it (the remote) back again. This is so much easier than the alternative.</li>
</ol>
<p>Best wishes,
Past Matt (with his annual flash of January git confidence).</p></p>

<p>In 2023, it was Germany or go home.</p>
<p>Went to Cologne in January. Here is photographic evidence:</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/images/2023/cologne-proof.jpeg" alt="Photographic evidence of my visit to Cologne"></p>
<p>We took the Eurostar via Brussels. A bit of a long day on the way back but much less stressful compared to flying.</p>
<p>We went to the Isle of Wight in June. It was the first time I&rsquo;d been since I was about 8. This time I didn&rsquo;t get Chicken Pox. Anyway, here is photographic evidence:</p></p>

        <p><p>A quick list of ten other albums I considered to be among the best of last year. I either listened to these less, or in the cases of &ldquo;Transmission Three&rdquo; and &ldquo;Be Opened By The Wonderful&rdquo; considered them to be ineligible as they are compilations.</p>

<p>Great album, recommended to me by Apple Music slinging the first track into my discovery feed back when that featured was added. Lots of earworms and a really good headphone listen. My top 10 was pretty dance heavy and putting this in might have added a few more guitars. Highly recommended.</p></p>
