    <p>On our first full day in Melbourne we took it easy. It was warm and sunny, so different to the weather we&rsquo;d left behind!</p>
<p>Ingrid needed more time than me to sleep off her jet-lag. I sat in the sunshine and read the book I&rsquo;d ignored on the plane. An easy read, it drew me into its characters. I&rsquo;ll post a review later, perhaps after I have read the sequel.</p>
<p>Later we took a tram ride to meet Ingrid&rsquo;s friend. Tess is a hairdresser so Ingrid and I each got haircuts. I can recommend it as a good way to freshen up for your holiday. The last time I had my hair cut by someone else was for the wedding. It was nice to be neat and tidy ahead of meeting the rel&rsquo;os. Tess gave me some tips on what to do when I cut my hair with clippers.</p>
<p>Ingrid and Tess both got married in the three and a half years since Ingrid left Australia. Both had never expected to do so. I can add myself as a third member of that club. We exchanged our mutual incredulity that we had. A bond between new friends and old.</p>
<p>As we left the salon, Ingrid dragged me across the road into a wine warehouse (&ldquo;This is a small one!&rdquo;) just to show me the difference between the UK and Australia. Even though we&rsquo;d only covered a small amount of ground on our first day, I began to realise that Melbourne is massive.</p>
<p>We spent the rest of the afternoon exploring Puckle street and the rest of Moonee Ponds. About halfway through a walk around the park we both felt beat so we headed back to base for a nap. Well I say nap, it was a more an extended session of chase the puppy and mop up after him until his owners got home.</p>
<p>That evening we had our first barbecue, a nice bit of kangaroo!</p>
