<h1>Reflections on 2023</h1>
<p>Jan. 2, 2024</p>
<br/><br/>
<h2 id="travel">Travel</h2>
<p>In 2023, it was Germany or go home.</p>
<p>Went to Cologne in January. Here is photographic evidence:</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/images/2023/cologne-proof.jpeg" alt="Photographic evidence of my visit to Cologne"></p>
<p>We took the Eurostar via Brussels. A bit of a long day on the way back but much less stressful compared to flying.</p>
<p>We went to the Isle of Wight in June. It was the first time I&rsquo;d been since I was about 8. This time I didn&rsquo;t get Chicken Pox. Anyway, here is photographic evidence:</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/images/2023/isle-of-wight-proof.jpeg" alt="Photographic evidence of my visit to the Isle of Wight"></p>
<p>Went to Berlin in July. Here is photographic evidence:</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/images/2023/berlin-proof.jpeg" alt="Photographic evidence of my visit to Berlin"></p>
<p>We flew with Easyjet. It feels like everything has fallen apart compared to pre-Brexit. (A flight to and from Germany in 2019 was pretty mediocre too, so it&rsquo;s not just the pandemic.) Anyway, the train is way better - but would have also taken about 15 hours and been a lot slower.</p>
<p>But Berlin was lovely. It was the tail end of a long heatwave, so the whole city felt drawn out and tired. Coming in from the non-event of a British summer this year it felt exciting. And of course, Berlin is so many places all in one place. A bit like London but with fewer wankers.</p>
<p>Less close to home, but not involving a ferry ride, we went to Gilbert White&rsquo;s house in September. Here is photographic evidence (both of going there and that I should have had a hair cut beforehand):</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/images/2023/gilbert-white-proof.jpeg" alt="Photographic evidence of my visit to Gilbert White&rsquo;s House"></p>
<p>I probably need to travel more in 2024, but as mentioned above, it seems so difficult right now.</p>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<p>Three books/series I liked in 2023:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Final Architecture series by Adrian Tchaikovsky. Two books into this trilogy and it&rsquo;s really interesting. The earth gets blown up eighty years before the book starts and things continue from there. I also read the third of AT&rsquo;s &ldquo;Children of Time&rdquo; series this year, &ldquo;Children of Memory&rdquo;, which was about 400 pages devoured in four days.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve started reading Proust. The more noteworthy achievement will be whether I manage to finish. I&rsquo;m really enjoying it, but it&rsquo;s so different to other writing. It&rsquo;s so detailed and full of references to lost things, it&rsquo;s a world unto itself. It&rsquo;s absolutely compelling and I&rsquo;ve barely scratched the surface so far. I will write more about my reasons for reading Proust in another post when I get closer to the end.</li>
<li>I really enjoyed reading Alan Rickman&rsquo;s diaries. He had what seemed like a very hectic but very enjoyable life. It has inspired me to be more brief in my writing, but also to capture more of what I do. I don&rsquo;t feel like I do very much by comparison, but am motivated to take up that challenge. Especially as the diaries start when Alan was my age.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;ve started keeping a book log, just to motivate myself to read a few more books. There are so many unread books hanging out rent-free in our house and I&rsquo;d love to crack them open and feast on the gooey secrets inside them. And the longer your nose spends in a book, the less time that it spends pressed up against your phone.</p>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>There was evolution rather than revolution at work. My direct report left us for a better job, while my own role was upgraded and put into alignment with some very talented colleagues. The chance to regularly discuss work with them has definitely been a change for the better.</p>
<p>I keep learning new things, but don&rsquo;t seem to get much chance to apply them. This means that new techniques don&rsquo;t seem to stick like they used to. I&rsquo;m going to try and make a difference to that in 2024.</p>
<p>What would my dream job be? I&rsquo;m well into my forties and I still don&rsquo;t know. I probably won&rsquo;t figure it out any time soon! For the time being, it&rsquo;s probably more about making my current job into my dream job, rather than setting off into the wild blue yonder.</p>
<h2 id="things-i-watched">Things I Watched</h2>
<ul>
<li>Drops of God</li>
<li>Foundation season 2</li>
<li>Drive My Car</li>
<li>Strange Way of Life</li>
<li>One Piece</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="continued-adventures-in-blogging">Continued adventures in blogging</h2>
<p>Integration of git and SSG is fun.</p>
<p>I still need to learn more CSS though.</p>
<p>I am still very distrustful of JavaScript frameworks (React etc) and of JS generally. That is probably changing but I do need to give myself more chances to find out what I can do, and that means actually doing things.</p>
<p>As for writing, it&rsquo;s fun. And despite things like Chat-GPT, it&rsquo;s never been more important to think and write, and to write and think.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-want-to-do-more-of-in-2024">What I want to do more of in 2024</h2>
<p>Finish things.</p>
<p>Take more photos.</p>
<p>Make more of a difference in the world. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be huge, it just has to be something.</p>
<p>Write more code.</p>
