    <p>A few months ago <a href="/jackson-x/">I wrote about an idea for a novel that I&rsquo;d abandoned</a>. I mentioned in that post that I&rsquo;d abandoned it because there was another idea that I wanted to pursue. The working title for it is &ldquo;Untitled 2&rdquo;. (It isn&rsquo;t really, I have an actual working title that would give things away or would at least make me feel like the idea was out in the world.)</p>
<p>In recent days I&rsquo;ve mulled over various post ideas and one idea was to write a big reveal of my vision for &ldquo;Untitled 2&rdquo;. I could set out what the novel would be about, the ideas it would grapple with, and when and where it would be set. Stuff like that.</p>
<p>But I realised that just as with <a href="/jackson-x/">Jackson X</a> and the Summer of the Space Whale, this would mean letting go of the project entirely - because if I let the cat out of the bag, I won&rsquo;t be able to write the novel I dream about.</p>
<p>At the same time, I realised that I wanted to write this post in order to try to set out the idea. It&rsquo;s hard enough to write a blog regularly as the long gaps between posts here are testament too. I don&rsquo;t think I could hammer out eight hundred words a day as well. (Though I guess I won&rsquo;t know unless I try.) And it&rsquo;s not as if that&rsquo;s the only difficulty, at least with a blog I can flit from one topic to another. With a novel I&rsquo;d have to shape it and make it coherent. Lots of editing would be involved. Ugh.</p>
<p>However, I do need to work through the principal ideas and see whether they&rsquo;re worth focussing on. I can see the benefits of at least trying to flesh out the ideas. There are aspects of the novel that I don&rsquo;t feel confident that I can write. As a result it might be useful to resist my urge to tell you what it&rsquo;s about and focus instead on producing posts to experiment and maybe develop that confidence.</p>
<p>After all, &ldquo;Untitled 2&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t have to be a fantastic novel, it just has to be mine. At least now I can sketch out the shape of the piece and try to set myself those confidence boosting tasks.</p>
<p>Finally, there was a day recently where I did sit and turn &ldquo;The Summer of the Space Whale&rdquo; into a more full-blown treatment. It ended up pretty complex. This pleased me because I did worry that it was an over-simple idea and that it couldn&rsquo;t be written into a &ldquo;proper novel&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s also been a worry for me when I&rsquo;ve though about &ldquo;Untitled 2&rdquo; but hopefully it will be similarly amenable.</p>
