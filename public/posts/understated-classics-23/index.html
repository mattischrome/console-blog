    <p>It was quite hard to choose an 808 State album for the <a href="understated-classics">understated classics series</a> for two reasons. The first is that I was introduced to 808 State quite late through a friend&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s cassette copy of The Shamen&rsquo;s En-Tact (the original version recorded from vinyl that had a thirteen minute version of &ldquo;Evil Is Eden&rdquo;) that also had &ndash; to fill out the C90 &ndash; the full length sweary version of &ldquo;What Time Is Love?&rdquo; by The KLF and four tracks: &ldquo;Cubik&rdquo;, &ldquo;Pacific&rdquo;, &ldquo;Olympic&rdquo; (I think&hellip;), and &ldquo;In Yer Face&rdquo;.</p>
<p>That early introduction only served to flag up the name and in the days when you had to wait months between album purchases (on cassette!) I didn&rsquo;t really get any more 808 State until I bought &ldquo;Lopez&rdquo; from &ldquo;Don Solaris&rdquo; on <em>cassette single</em> mainly because, if I recall correctly, I was mad on The Propellerheads at the time and wanted their remix. I soon came to prefer the languid original though, and eventually, in 1998 I bought the cassette version of their Greatest Hits (at the time) <em>808:88:98</em>. Happy days. An album so good that I tracked down a CD version on eBay a while later.</p>
<p>So reason number one is that my overall favourite 808 State album is that undoubtedly fan-polarising compilation, chiefly because it&rsquo;s hooked in to bobbing between home and college (a good hour&rsquo;s walk) believing that I was the only person of my peer group remotely interested in this music.</p>
<p>Reason number two is rather more prosaic. I now own five studio albums by 808 State and I really can&rsquo;t decide which I like best. I also have another compilation &ndash; <em>Blueprint</em>, released a few years back &ndash; and even that is interesting for its own reasons (but can&rsquo;t beat the heady A to B rush of <em>808:88:98</em>). In the end I&rsquo;ve decided on 1993&rsquo;s <em>Gorgeous</em> because it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;one in the middle&rdquo; and it happens to contain <em>Plan 9</em>, which is my all-time fave 808 State track.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll spare you a track-by-track trip through the track list but you should there&rsquo;s some good stuff on here, not least the aforementioned <em>Plan 9</em> (a beautiful lilting guitar riff with an urgent but not over the top bass line), <em>One In Ten</em> (the UB40 collab that references unemployment statistics that I instead collared as my own personal bisexual pride anthem), <em>10x10</em> (the uplifting house anthem that will leave you smiling for days), <em>Moses</em> (featuring Ian McCulloch in the Bernard Sumner role &ndash; see <em>EX:EL</em> for more details), and <em>Europa</em> (a beautiful intro with bells and a bizarrely Stock, Aitken &amp; Waterman spoofing female vocal). Oh and <em>Contrique</em> samples <em>She&rsquo;s Lost Control</em> by Joy Division!</p>
<p>My only issue with the album is a weird quirk of the sequencing. There are fifteen tracks and regular readers will know that I love a short album, so I&rsquo;d prefer it if <em>Gorgeous</em> ended with the moody drum-centred <em>Colony</em> (a nice eleven tracks if you don&rsquo;t mind). Instead the remaining four tracks &ndash; <em>Timebomb</em>, <em>Stormin&rsquo; Norman</em> (How nineties a reference is that!), <em>Sexy Dancer</em>, and <em>Sexy Synthesizer</em> &ndash; add pretty much another EP on to the end of the album. It doesn&rsquo;t help that <em>Stormin&rsquo; Norman</em> and <em>Sexy Dancer</em> are actually awful. I quite like <em>Sexy Synthesizer</em> though, it reminds me of <em>Last Train To Trancentral</em> by The KLF and perhaps its pairing with <em>Sexy Dancer</em> has some sort of &ldquo;Revenge of the Nerds&rdquo; thing going on.</p>
<p>Overall though, <em>Gorgeous</em> is a pretty amazing sounding album that has aged well to my ears, only those last two tracks (and possibly the faux saxophone of <em>Black Morpheus</em>) sound vaguely nineties. The rest is finely honed and stylish modern dance music that you really should wrap your ears around some time.</p>
