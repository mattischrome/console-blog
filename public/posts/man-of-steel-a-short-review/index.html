    <p>Today I went to see the new Superman reboot <em>Man of Steel</em> with friends. I really enjoyed it, particularly the more reflective take on the superhero myth. Starting out with the fate of the planet Krypton, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0770828/"><em>Man of Steel</em></a> approximately fuses the events of both the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0078346/?ref_=sr_2">first</a> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081573/">two</a> original Superman movies. We get to see Superman&rsquo;s arrival and childhood on earth and then the arrival of Zod, a maniac bent on replacing the earth and everyone on it with a new race of Kryptonians.</p>
<p>I think the slower and more considered take on Superman&rsquo;s youth as Clark Kent is really interesting and well made: should he intervene to save lives at the cost of revealing the extent of his powers? It&rsquo;s really unshowy, almost like a mystery as Clark drifts from job to job remembering episodes from his childhood as he goes. For me that&rsquo;s the best half of the film.</p>
<p><em>Man Of Steel</em> is very much two films. After Zod shows up, some initially impressive fight sequences get repeated a bit too much for my taste. These scenes are also well made, there is a crushing heft to them and in a nod to audiences watching in 3D there&rsquo;s lots of stuff that gets flung around and all sorts of people and tanks and trains get blasted through walls. Personally I liked seeing it without depth, though unfortunately the obvious <a href="star-trek-into-darkness-a-short-review">problems with movies that are made for 3D</a> don&rsquo;t necessarily vanish by watching the film in 2D. There are still scenes that are too busy and not only that, the ultraviolent smashing and crashing just gets a bit boring after a bit: all that excellent storytelling in the first half is just undone. It isn&rsquo;t tense because you know that Superman will win and the fact that Metropolis is almost totally trashed by the end doesn&rsquo;t seem to matter because &ndash; in a fashion reminiscent of <a href="/fast-furious-6-a-short-review/">Fast &amp; Furious 6&rsquo;s tank</a> &ndash; all the terrible aftermath is tucked away and the gigadeath that you don&rsquo;t see isn&rsquo;t really alluded to in the final scenes either.</p>
<p>Finally some miscellaneous points:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a tanker with a LEXCORP logo on it in one scene. Is this a little in-joke or will there be a sequel featuring Lex Luthor?</li>
<li>Russell Crowe is not that annoying as Jor-El, which was a surprise.</li>
<li>Henry Cavill, who plays Clark/Kal-El/Superman is pretty good in Immortals, the underrated swords and sandals epic from director Tarsem.</li>
<li>Michael Shannon&rsquo;s voice as Zod seems to be channeling The Brain from &ldquo;Pinky and the Brain&rdquo;. Fitting as he is trying to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5TU8o6TvNk">&ldquo;take over the world&rdquo;</a>. Needless to say it&rsquo;s not as good as Terrence Stamp&rsquo;s rollicking turn in <em>Superman 2</em>.</li>
<li>These are the rules of black holes in this movie: a) to be exiled in a black hole, you get sent there in a penis-shaped rocket, b) if you get sent to one you grow a goatee beard, and c) they automatically close once all but one of the bad guys has disappeared into it.</li>
<li>That&rsquo;s not an S, it&rsquo;s a Kryptonian symbol for hope.</li>
</ol>
