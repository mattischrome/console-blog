<h1>Decision to Leave</h1>
<p>May. 31, 2023</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>I gave up writing reviews of movies because:</p>
<ol>
<li>I never felt I got the balance right between describing the plot and why I liked the film.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t watch enough movies to be able to draw comparisons that are interesting, just between the small subset of total films that I have watched.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t know enough about film making to properly describe why a movie made me feel a particular way and how to discuss the different possibilities available to the director, the actors, and the other artists involved with creating a movie.</li>
</ol>
<p>But of course, every now and then you see a movie and think &ldquo;wow! I need to tell people about this&rdquo;. And for me that recent film was &ldquo;Decision To Leave&rdquo;, a Korean film that was released last year.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s tricky to explain what &ldquo;Decision to Leave&rdquo; is about without giving too much of the plot away, especially if I also want to explain why I enjoyed it so much. Basically, a detective falls in love with a suspect in a murder case, realises that she might actually have done it, lets her go and then moves to another town to get over it. Well there&rsquo;s more to it than that but that will do as a description for now.</p>
<p>What made &ldquo;Decision to Leave&rdquo; so compelling?</p>
<ol>
<li>The setting. Most of the Korean-ness of the movie comes across in food and customs and so on. Beyond that there&rsquo;s a sense of universality to the story and with the odd tweak the action could be happening almost anywhere. (I guess a Hollywood remake could be due any minute now.) One of the reasons I love foreign movies is that they allow you to see other places and live there for a bit (at least in an emotional sense), but this film also has very universal views about sex, about technology, about social media.</li>
<li>The acting. As I said above, I don&rsquo;t really know much about film so I could be writing absolute rubbish here, but the performances felt very natural to me. At least in the sense that the main characters are essentially playing roles throughout - the police detective has to conceal his feelings while continuing his investigation, the suspect has to simultaneously disguise her actions and motives while also attempting to seduce the detective.</li>
<li>The cinematography. Not just the choice of shots but also how natural they all feel. There were some points when shots melted from one to another in such a clever way, and at other points really striking choices had been made about how to stage a particular scene. (And this is the point where my not having watched many films lately kicks in, because I have really no idea to what extent these shots and choices for staging are novel or not&hellip;) The film also looks really expensive, or rather not cheap. There are drone shots, beautifully lit night-time exteriors and interiors, and the transitions between some of the shots are really compelling, just the right side of the line between showy and showoff-y.</li>
</ol>
<p>So that concludes my rather brief review of Decision to Leave. I recommend it if you like well-acted and visually striking films with a compelling and satisfying story. If the subtitles put you off, don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;m pretty sure an English-language remake will be just around the corner!</p>
