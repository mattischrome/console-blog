<h1>More Uses For Little Notebooks</h1>
<p>Feb. 4, 2025</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>I&rsquo;m an avid collector of small notebooks. So much so that I have a box full of them in my office. I&rsquo;m not afraid of writing in them, it&rsquo;s just that I&rsquo;ve bought so many over the years I can&rsquo;t get through them quick enough.</p>
<p>The mania began with Field Notes shortly after I got back from South America. That trip made me hyperaware of the need for a notebook that was always with you. Fortunately, when travelling a camera can often take the place of a notebook. It allows you to capture the moment, though not always the exact thought going through your head when you presser the shutter down.</p>
<p>And it can really help to capture thoughts rather than just things or scenes. It is well known that human vision captures a totally different scene to a camera lens and often a scene will look totally different to the memory when you come to look at your photos later. (Great photographers know this and have some innate sense of how to frame a scene as though an observer.) So capturing thoughts - the why of the scene as well as the what - can be more useful than a photograph, or useful in a different way.</p>
<p>Lately though, I don&rsquo;t seem to be out and about that much. My job is very much deskbound and beholden to a majority in my team who don&rsquo;t like to come to the office. So I&rsquo;m stuck at home and sedentary. But there&rsquo;s still a use for the little notebooks. Growing weary of the array of post-it notes stuck along the bottom of my monitor, I decided to collate the content of them into one of my notebooks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a nice way to make sure I actually act on my post-it notes too. All too often I would let them linger, but now with the notebook I can intentionally review them instead of waiting for the light glue to wear off so much that it becomes impossible to stick it back up. In that scenario, I&rsquo;d often decide that I <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> need to keep the information and screw it up for the cat to play with. (Martok loves a slightly sticky post-it paper ball, something about the stickiness makes it a better bit of prey.)</p>
<p>Of course, now the problem I have is what to do with all these blocks of Post-it notes!</p>
