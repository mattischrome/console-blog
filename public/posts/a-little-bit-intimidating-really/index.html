<h1>A Little Bit Intimidating Really</h1>
<p>Mar. 22, 2015</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>There is so much good writing out there. All you have to do is fire up <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/">the guardian website</a>, or download the <a href="https://medium.com/m/app">medium app to your smartphone</a>, or visit <a href="http://xianity.me/">my friend Barrie&rsquo;s site</a>, or <a href="https://narami.wordpress.com/">Lee&rsquo;s</a>, and so on and so on.</p>
<p>When it comes to my little whisper into this great choir, it&rsquo;s easy to feel a bit intimidated. How do I add my voice? How do I feel distinct? How do I do it as well as all these other wonderful writers?</p>
<p>You might think that after nearly four years and over five hundred posts, I might be less timorous. I can assure you that I still feel nervous about every single post. Almost every time I write a post I get hung up on a detail that prevents me writing. I find the biggest source of writer&rsquo;s block is worrying about whether any of it matters.</p>
<p>And does any of it matter? Not particularly, not in the grand scheme of things. One thing I appreciate more after four years is that you do have to let things go. You can accept that you won&rsquo;t win on the first try.</p>
<p>As with most good things in life, it is more gratifying to succeed after a struggle. I don&rsquo;t believe that simply turning up again and again entitles you to succeed. However, I believe that when you do, you accept the challenge of learning and adapting.</p>
<p>The beauty of life is that as you get better at something, you find new aspects to improve upon and new things that make you worry. Even with this self-awareness you will struggle and get stuck, sometimes you can improve too much in one go and leave yourself open to regression to the mean. It&rsquo;s like training for a run, at any given time you can only put in a sustainable effort - if you try too hard too soon you might injure yourself.</p>
<p>I may well find it intimidating that there is so much other good writing out there but I also know that it is there for me to enjoy, that it communicates to me in a special way. The last few years made me realise that I am in the world, that the world is beautiful, and I am very happy to take my place in it.</p>
