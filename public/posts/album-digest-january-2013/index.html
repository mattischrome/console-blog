    <p>Only one of this month three albums was actually released this month. Nelly Furtado&rsquo;s Mi plan was actually released over three years ago - I only discovered it last year when I wrote <a href="album-digest-september-2012">the September album digest</a> following the release of &ldquo;The Spirit Indestructible&rdquo;, or it might have been when I wrote about <a href="uc20">&ldquo;Folklore&rdquo;</a> at around the same time.</p>
<p>Anyway, I guess these are albums that I bought with my Christmas gift vouchers!</p>
<h2 id="everything-everything-arc">Everything Everything &ldquo;Arc&rdquo;</h2>
<p>I suppose I had better start with albums actually released this month. Before listening listening to the iTunes previews of Arc I&rsquo;d not heard anything anything by Everything Everything (pun is author&rsquo;s own!) but I was quite impressed.</p>
<p>Much is made in reviews of their glitchy sounds and hyperactive cut-up songs, but to my mind &ldquo;Arc&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t sound too different to the second Longpigs album &ldquo;Mobile Home&rdquo;. This was the album that did for the Longpigs as a band, leaving us with Richard Hawley&rsquo;s solo career and &ldquo;On and On&rdquo; at funerals. However &ldquo;Arc&rdquo; does sound bang up to date. More importantly they sound like a band in command of their sound rather than one that is falling apart.</p>
<p>All that hyperactivity is the sound of ideas jostling with one another. It&rsquo;s infectious too; the first time I listened all the way through, I came up with about five ideas for song lyrics of my own (and I have written any lyrics for going on ten years now).</p>
<p>I just wish the lead singer didn&rsquo;t sing so high (as said every reviewer my age when they heard &ldquo;The Bends&rdquo; by Radiohead) because I think there are moments where he sounds more comfortable and more expressive singing lower. I guess they will figure that out in time.</p>
<p>I should point out some highlights. For me the best tune is the opening track &ldquo;Cough Cough&rdquo; and I think it&rsquo;s the most successful of the songs here that are experiments. Elsewhere, gluing songs together so that they end in the middle just as they begin is a bit like turning the Mona Lisa into a Mobius strip: it doesn&rsquo;t really add to the picture and it looks amateurish when you can see the join.</p>
<p>Also great is &ldquo;Undrowned&rdquo;, which I&rsquo;d say is a little less experimental that instead relies on a sing-song tune and sinister wordplay in the lyrics. It&rsquo;s like the world&rsquo;s most malevolent nursery rhyme. I can just picture it now in a songtage at the end of a gritty crime drama set on a council estate.</p>
<p>Overall &ldquo;Arc&rdquo; is an album that&rsquo;s fun and is over quickly. Some of the ideas go places, others don&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s great, because next time out we either get to hear a band hitting their stride (like Foals on their second album) or reinventing to develop some consistency (think of something like &ldquo;Skying&rdquo; by The Horrors). A pretty good January album.</p>
<h2 id="frank-ocean-channel-orange">Frank Ocean &ldquo;channel ORANGE&rdquo;</h2>
<p>A friend of mine whose taste I trust without reservation recommended Frank Ocean&rsquo;s previous album (&ldquo;Nostalgia Ultra&rdquo;) to me a while back. On that occasion I decided to exercise a reservation despite my friend&rsquo;s great taste because I didn&rsquo;t approve of Odd Future&rsquo;s distasteful lyrics (and still don&rsquo;t).</p>
<p>Later on though, I came across the video to &ldquo;Swim Good&rdquo;, which is an amazing song. In fact, I&rsquo;m going to embed it right here, right now:</p>
<p>See? Amazing. So I took advantage of &ldquo;channel ORANGE&rdquo; being sold for peanuts on the iTunes Store over Christmas and have really enjoyed it. The album seems to mostly be about unrequited love (ah, something I can relate to) and drugs (…and something I can&rsquo;t…). Let&rsquo;s just say that &ldquo;Thinking Bout You&rdquo; kind of resonates with me. I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ve ever felt quite as bad as he purports to on the excellent and devastating &ldquo;Bad Religion&rdquo; but I think I get the sentiment on &ldquo;Pilot Jones&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m not sure though, I might be too square to properly appreciate the lyrics).</p>
<p>Elsewhere there are songs that are really interesting from a musical point of view too. (Talented songwriter in musically interesting shock!) Probably the best track in this regard is &ldquo;Pyramid&rdquo;, something this ambitious is rarely seen on a pop album. It juxtaposes two tales over ten minutes, one in ancient Egypt and another in modern America, so it&rsquo;s great lyrically - but the musical flourishes interest me more: the trance breakdown, the vocoders, and perhaps most surprisingly, the Led Zeppelin-esque guitar solo at the end. There are lots of little musical and sample-based interludes like &ldquo;White&rdquo; too.</p>
<p>I also really like &ldquo;Super Rich Kids&rdquo;, which has just the right amount of pathos to cut with its satire of… well… super rich kids. The lyrics go from arrogance &ldquo;A million one, a million two / A hundred more will never do&rdquo; to despair &ldquo;I end my day upon the roof / I say I&rsquo;ll jump, I never do&rdquo; (another line that resonates). Talking of great lines, &ldquo;Why see the world when you&rsquo;ve got the beach?&rdquo; from &ldquo;Sweet Life&rdquo; is similarly excellent.</p>
<p>My absolute favourite though is &ldquo;Pink Matter&rdquo;, which reminds me how much I&rsquo;ve missed Andre 3000. Again the song itself is a combination of a great lyric with a spooky spare arrangement that manages to underpin things in a simple, sexy and unfussy way. And all that business about the nature of thought in the lines &ldquo;What do you think my brain is made for? / Is it just a container for the mind? / This great grey matter&rdquo; echoes a lot of the thoughts I&rsquo;ve been having lately.</p>
<h2 id="nelly-furtado-mi-plan">Nelly Furtado &ldquo;Mi Plan&rdquo;</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth checking the reviews of this album out on iTunes, particularly the ones from boneheads who think she&rsquo;s insulted them in some way by having the audacity to record an album in Spanish. It&rsquo;s hilarious (but also really disappointing) that people feel threatened by foreign languages.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, although the songs on &ldquo;Mi Plan&rdquo; are pretty good and quite fun, they do seem rather conservative. Now I&rsquo;m not saying that I expected a Spanish language Nelly Furtado album to be a hip-hop concept album about the life and work of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frida_Kahlo">Frida Kahlo</a>, but &ldquo;Mi Plan&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t have the sparkle and sass of &ldquo;Loose&rdquo;. I would have thought it might have the vibrancy of &ldquo;Whoah Nelly&rdquo; but not really, there&rsquo;s more duets than I expected with guys who sound much older than her. It&rsquo;s all a little… stiff.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I do really enjoy songs like &ldquo;Manos Al Aire&rdquo;, &ldquo;Bajo Otra Luz&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fantasmas&rdquo;. What&rsquo;s more, I like to shuffle all Nelly&rsquo;s songs on my phone and any of these  songs are a fine contribution when they come up (even if there&rsquo;s some weird sounding dude warbling on them too).</p>
