    <p>The hat in question is a Wilco baseball cap that I bought at a gig of theirs in 2004, the night that Germany got eliminated from Euro 2004. I&rsquo;d love to show you a picture of it but I can&rsquo;t, there isn&rsquo;t even a picture of it from a Wilco merch site: at least not one that Google or Bing images can see anyway. I did manage to find a side-on picture of it in my bedroom in 2005 and zoom right in on it like they do in CSI.</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/images/other/That-Hat.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>But to start we have to go back a bit further to Easter in 2004, with everyone away from the flat where I lived. I must have been up at 5 AM to listen to a copy of Wilco’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Ghost_Is_Born">“A Ghost is Born&quot;</a> that I’d downloaded off the net - damn I can&rsquo;t even remember the name of the software but this one guy had so many cool albums - and AGIB just blew me away. A heady mix of great music and sleep deprivation no doubt.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few months and I&rsquo;m <a href="http://www.wedgewood-rooms.co.uk">back in my home town</a> enthusing to two guys from <a href="http://www.choosechicago.com">Wilco&rsquo;s hometown</a> in the street outside of a kebab shop after the gig. I&rsquo;m eating kebab shop chips and am filled with the zeal of someone who&rsquo;s had their artistic nipple tweaked and is talking to strangers and is wearing this totally sweet hat.</p>
<p>That hat, or rather the gig where I got it from, is where mattischrome was born — the new name of my alter ego — the name of my entire online identity (including this blog thanks to the nation of Montenegro) stems from the username I invented for <a href="http://forums.viachicago.org">a Wilco message board</a>: one that I joined so that I could download pictures of that gig (and most importantly the set list). “Hell is Chrome” is the second track on &ldquo;A Ghost is Born&rdquo; and it’s ace. “Matt is Chrome&quot;, given my early greying hair, seemed like a witty and sensible appropriation. Of course, it now makes everyone think that I am a <a href="http://www.thinkbabynames.com/meaning/1/Matti">Swedish guy named Mattis</a> who really likes <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/">Google&rsquo;s browser</a> (which did not exist at this time, nor did Gmail strangely enough which is why the first mattischrome account is a <a href="http://mashable.com/category/hotmail/">Hotmail</a>).</p>
<p>The next day <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/euro_2004/3830451.stm">England lost to Portugal on penalties</a> in Lisbon. Within a year (three months come to think of it) I&rsquo;d be in love with a Portuguese woman and in love with her culture and nation too. It feels like the majority of my life has been lived since then. Back then I couldn’t speak Portuguese which just feels weird somehow.</p>
<p>So whatever happened to that hat? Well it was always around, usually hanging from a tall lamp in the corner of my bedroom until the day I moved away from St Albans. That day my friend Albert helped me move out. He swiped the hat and looked better wearing it than I ever did, so I let him keep it. Perhaps he still has it.</p>
