<h1>A Work Of Art At The End Of My Road?</h1>
<p>Mar. 5, 2013</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>I have had a lot of ideas for posts swirling around in my head in recent days. This is because I have actually done quite a lot of cool things in that time, and because I have hung out with some great people who make me think, and because I always have a whole load of things bouncing around in there anyway - space junk of the mind. I was thinking about how to put together these thoughts I have been having about art and about stories and yes, about love too. It all kind of got muddled up and then I saw it.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;give way&rdquo; sign at the end of my road was flashing and at the same time <a href="http://uw09.unseenworlds.net/track/appalachian-grove-iii">Laurie Spiegel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Appalachian Grove III&rdquo;</a> was playing on my iPhone. I was listening to it today because I was on the underground and it&rsquo;s the only thing I had downloaded to my phone. When I say that the sign was flashing, I mean the light that illuminates it by night of course. And as it blinked away with the last entrails of daylight smeared across the horizon behind, a fitful and needless light that sparked in and out of time with the gated sounds of the Spiegel piece, I felt a great sense of joy in seeing everything I wanted to write about there in front of me.</p>
<p>So was it art? A chance happening of a fitful faulty light flashing in the twilight with an observer who had just the right music playing in his ears at the time? Perhaps. It can&rsquo;t be preserved now (I thought about getting the phone out and shooting a video but that wouldn&rsquo;t have had the music; it might also have meant stopping the music too) except as my anecdote to you now.</p>
<p>On Friday night, I went to <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/bigger-splash-painting-after-performance">&ldquo;A Bigger Splash&rdquo;</a> the exhibition at the Tate Modern about how painting has changed under the influence of performance art. In fine company I was able to look at and think about some very strange pieces that I perhaps would not have considered for too long otherwise,  due to both the exhibition and my thoughtful companion - I think I would have rushed it had I been alone. I&rsquo;d recommend it on the caveat that it is rather wonky in places, but it&rsquo;s fine if you take it in good humour. It does get a little tiring towards the end, the rooms dedicated to explaining ideas using multiple artists are much better than the ones dedicated to a single artist.</p>
<p>To finish I shall tell you what happened next. I eventually walked away from the scene, grinning like a loon. As I got to almost-home the track changed and I looked back: the give way sign glowed back at me and did not flicker for an instant. It seemed darker now. Different music and different light: a different world.</p>
