<h1>2023 Albums of the Year #10: Wata Igarashi, Agartha</h1>
<p>Dec. 22, 2023</p>
<br/><br/>
<p><img src="../../assets/images/albums-2023/wata-igarashi-agartha.jpeg" alt="Cover of Agartha by Wata Igarashi"></p>
<p>Agartha is the debut album by Japanese electronic artist Wata Igarashi. I don&rsquo;t really know much about him, but I do know that I enjoy releases on the German record label Kompakt and I have really enjoyed Japanese techno in recent years. Over lockdown I discovered Haruomi Hosono&rsquo;s &ldquo;Polyharmony&rdquo; album and re-discovered the work of Shinichi Atobe, particularly their album &ldquo;Love of Plastic&rdquo;. Both of those albums could be future understated classics and while both are by Japanese artists working in electronic music, there the comparison ends.</p>
<p>The fact that Agartha is released on renowned German techno label Kompakt will give you plenty of clues to its sound, though as the year wore on I became impressed with just how German-sounding the album is. There&rsquo;s a Neu!-like quality to early track &ldquo;Subterranean Life&rdquo; and other tracks put me in mind of the great album &ldquo;Tago Mago&rdquo; by CAN. The influences are not just German though, there are hints of Philip Glass towards the end of &ldquo;Ceremony of the Dead&rdquo; with its minimalist choral arrangements.</p>
<p>I think one of the tracks was featured on Tim Sweeney&rsquo;s Beats in Space radio show, which I&rsquo;ve found to be a consistent source of good new music this year (probably the aforementioned &ldquo;Subterranean Life&rdquo; or the title track), and then the album got a good review on Resident Adviser. Strangely the album was not reviewed on Pitchfork, which means I have had to think for myself about why I like this album so much.</p>
<p>Part of the reason is tracks like &ldquo;Floating Against Time&rdquo; which have a dreamlike quality to them, full of floaty arpeggios and glorious modular washes. It&rsquo;s the sort of electronic music that I love to lose myself in. Literally in some cases, as I think this is one of the albums I have most often fallen asleep to  this year. I have said on plenty of occasions that this is not a bad quality for an album to have!</p>
