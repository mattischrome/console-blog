<h1>Adventures with Discover Weekly</h1>
<p>Aug. 30, 2016</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>Because I couldn&rsquo;t find any albums coming out this month that I wanted to review for the album digest, I decided to let Spotify pick the albums to listen to. I listened to my algorithmically chosen <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/20/why-browse-when-you-can-play/">Discover Weekly</a> playlist one week and selected albums based on the songs that I liked the most. The album also had to be released in 2016. The selections are ones that got away.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done this before. <a href="/album-digest-august-2012/">Three of the four albums that I wrote about in August four years ago</a> were selected by <a href="https://bleep.com">Bleep</a>: they were in the &lsquo;best albums of the year so far&rsquo; bundle that I bought. So this month&rsquo;s album digest is bought to you by the same idea, just a different curator.</p>
<p>In general I find that DW is OK at finding songs that I like. It picks thirty songs a week and it cleverly doesn&rsquo;t bother to change them unless you&rsquo;ve listened to at least one song. You can&rsquo;t decide that you don&rsquo;t like the look of it, you have to give at least one song a go. That may have led me to more discoveries than anything else. Most weeks it picks at least four or five songs that I&rsquo;d listen to more than once. It knows that I like long remixes and proggy instrumentals. For a while I found its selections rather morose, but it&rsquo;s cheered up in recent weeks.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s starting to learn that I like new music too. Today <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/spotifydiscover/playlist/2RCUVNJOvLOhcWenkt0ECQ?gtm=1">I listened to an hour of this week&rsquo;s DW</a> and about seven of the songs were released in either July or August. You can see now why I am interested in what it might pick out for me in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>However, in the album digest I won&rsquo;t conjecture as to why I ended up listening to those particular albums. I need to follow its suggestions for a bit longer before I start to analyse them. A musical prediction machines raises all sorts of questions, the kind that I like to ponder the answers to. Not least the decreasing moroseness! <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/theslice/how-internet-algorithms-can-help-us-be-better-humans">Is it making me happier?</a> Am I feeding it happier data points? Or was it because I complained about it to @SpotifyCares on Twitter? Watch (or listen to) this space and perhaps I&rsquo;ll figure it out.</p>
