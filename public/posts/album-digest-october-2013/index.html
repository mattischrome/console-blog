<h1>Album Digest, October 2013</h1>
<p>Oct. 31, 2013</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>Four great albums this month for the last album digest in a while.</p>
<h2 id="chvrches-the-bones-of-what-you-believe">CHVRCHES &ldquo;The Bones Of What You Believe&rdquo;</h2>
<p>I first got into CHVRCHES on Record Store Day, one of my purchases was an Irn Bru coloured 12&quot; of the Recover EP that, according to eBay, tripled in value over night. Judging by this, their full debut, my see-through orange slab of happiness may hold its value, because it&rsquo;s clear that CHVRCHES should be around for the long haul. &ldquo;The Bones Of What You Believe&rdquo; is a master class in upbeat pop songwriting that doesn&rsquo;t have to pander to the lowest common denominator.</p>
<p>In fact the only real flaw in this album is that it might be slightly <em>too</em> relentless; while I was still getting to know the songs it was rather exhausting to listen to this slew of upbeat music and the album as a whole could do with a couple more changes of pace. As it is, the only slow song is the last one - although the two bonus songs on the limited edition (thanks Spotify!) are good enough and slow enough that their inclusion on the album proper could have a good album great.</p>
<p>Quality is consistently high but the best tracks are the ones already released as singles: &ldquo;The Mother We Share&rdquo;, &ldquo;Recover&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Gun&rdquo; which might be the best out-and-out pop song I&rsquo;ve heard so far this year save for Vampire Weekend&rsquo;s &ldquo;Diane Young&rdquo;. However, there&rsquo;s some great supporting stuff in the rest of the track listing: &ldquo;Lies&rdquo; arrives at the point where the CHVRCHES formula begins to make sense and is appropriately euphoric; &ldquo;Night Sky&rdquo; is a wonderful song, though I did think it was &ldquo;Nice Guy&rdquo; for a while; and &ldquo;Under The Tide&rdquo; shows that there&rsquo;s more than one vocalist in the band.</p>
<p>Overall it&rsquo;s a good pop album and I&rsquo;m really keen to see where they go next.</p>
<h2 id="darkside-psychic">DARKSIDE &ldquo;Psychic&rdquo;</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m almost at the end of this first section of monthly album digests - a run of 34 consecutive monthly posts about at least three albums. Because I love music it has not been difficult to do and my skill at writing these puff pieces about albums I like has increased over this time. Early on I did find it a little difficult to find and write about enough albums and perhaps my biggest regret is the short shrift that I gave to Nicholas Jaar&rsquo;s excellent album &ldquo;Space Is Only Noise&rdquo;, something that only happened because I simply hadn&rsquo;t spent enough time listening to it.</p>
<p>DARKSIDE are a collaboration between Nicholas Jaar and guitarist Dave Harrington, and &ldquo;Psychic&rdquo; is their first proper album. In order to atone for past mistakes, I made sure that I listened to it <em>a lot</em> and it was a very rewarding experience. I said back in May that I thought that Vampire Weekend&rsquo;s would probably be my favourite come the year&rsquo;s end but I have to say that &ldquo;Psychic&rdquo; runs &ldquo;Modern Vampires Of The City&rdquo; pretty close. Of course it does this in spite of (or perhaps because of) being a completely different kettle of fish. While &ldquo;Psychic&rdquo; is a bit less electronic than &ldquo;Space Is Only Noise&rdquo;, it certainly operates in a similar way - presenting music that is exploded into its constituent elements and explored.</p>
<p>The result is a very mellow and spacious album that seems to unfold in a different way with each listen. The highlights are &ldquo;Golden Arrow&rdquo; - a glorious 11 minute deconstruction in which the remains of who knows what kind of track are smeared around your headphones - and &ldquo;Metatron&rdquo;, which closes the album and is probably the closest thing to a recognisable song here. Highly recommended.</p>
<h2 id="four-tet-beautiful-rewind">Four Tet &ldquo;Beautiful Rewind&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Another fine album from Four Tet this, it is more like &ldquo;There Is Love In You&rdquo; than last July&rsquo;s singles collection &ldquo;Pink&rdquo;. All the tracks are quite short and the whole forty minutes flies by, ebbing and flowing in that wonderful Four Tet way. When I went to see Radiohead in Spain back in 2002, Four Tet were the support act and I bought a t-shirt in celebration of this (I&rsquo;d been a massive Fridge fan). That shirt was emblazoned with the title of a track from his second album &ldquo;Pause&rdquo; - &ldquo;Everything Is Alright&rdquo;. I think it&rsquo;s great that ten years on, he&rsquo;s creating music that makes me feel just that!</p>
<h2 id="haim-days-are-gone">HAIM &ldquo;Days Are Gone&rdquo;</h2>
<p>I really like this album but I can&rsquo;t think of anything interesting to say about it! And yes, I have listened to it a lot! Perhaps I just need to live with it a little more before it starts to mean something.</p>
