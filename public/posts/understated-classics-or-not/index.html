    <p>At the new year, thoughts and spare time for writing point me toward writing some new posts for my understated classics series. Expect some new ones soon.</p>
<p>I also reflected on my previous choices and thought a bit about how my music tastes have changed recently. Some of this has to do with streaming and the frustrations I wrote about <a href="https://mattischrome.com/a-pox-on-both-their-houses">in my last post</a>. Some of it is just down to getting older: I have less time to listen to new music, and much of the &rsquo;new&rsquo; stuff I listen to is me investigating the stuff I missed first time around. Who knew Art of Noise were so good? Not me, but I do now!</p>
<p>For example, I listened to <em>Foxbase Alpha</em> and <em>So Tough</em> by Saint Etienne so much in 2021! I think I would now pick one of those two and not <a href="https://mattischrome.com/understated-classics-09"><em>Tiger Bay</em></a> if I were picking one for an understated classic tomorrow. I don&rsquo;t have a rule that says I can&rsquo;t pick a band twice, but I think that doing so means missing out something else – at least in the short term. If I manage to get through what is already quite a long list, one of <em>Foxbase Alpha</em> and <em>So Tough</em> will be early on the repeated bands list.</p>
<p>I should also mention that Saint Etienne made a fine album in 2021 called <em>I&rsquo;ve been trying to tell you</em>. The vinyl is a beautiful object. The question of why we need beautiful vinyl records (and whether we deserve them) should be the subject of yet another future post. In case I get don&rsquo;t get around to it, the answer is yes: to protect our privacy, to get back to appreciating albums in their entirety, and as a more fun version of <a href="https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique">the Pomodoro technique</a>.</p>
<p>I had another moment recently where a song came up on an algo-generated playlist and I said to Ingrid, &ldquo;Oh, I used to listen to this album all the time 20 years ago&rdquo;. Later, I said, &ldquo;Maybe it should be one of my understated classics?&rdquo; Re-listening to the whole album later that day, I realised that there is a big difference between the albums that you continue to listen to over 20 years and the ones you get reminded about 20 years later. It really is a matter of whether an album sticks to you and I realised that this one hadn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Every so often, the album does the living before it reaches you. For example, <a href="https://mattischrome.com/understated-classics-28"><em>The Meadowlands</em> by The Wrens</a>. Its follow-up is now all-but-cancelled by the release of <em>Observatory</em> by Aeon Station, the new band of one of the Wrens. On <em>Observatory</em>, you can hear the Wrens sound trying to form, but there&rsquo;s something missing – something that might unfortunately now never see the light of day. As someone who tends to leave the delivery of projects late, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/nov/24/its-repulsive-to-me-the-bitter-feud-of-indie-rockers-the-wrens">I can empathise with both sides of their dispute</a> and can see the value of getting things finished!</p>
<p>People always scoff somewhat at my choice of <a href="https://mattischrome.com/understated-classics-10"><em>Tubular Bells 2</em></a> as an understated classic. I maintain that it&rsquo;s a gorgeous album and as good an advert for modern audio technology as anything else made in 1992. Yes, it&rsquo;s 30 years old this year. I imagine the album&rsquo;s perceived cash-in nature might prevent a deluxe re-release, which is a shame because I&rsquo;d stump up for it. The only physical copy I&rsquo;ve ever owned was a cassette and I lost that long ago. I&rsquo;m a prime candidate for a deluxe box set!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when you listen to <em>Tubular Bells 2</em> on Apple Music, the service swaps out the stunning eight-minute version of Sentinel for the &lsquo;Early Stages&rsquo; demo version (which in itself is <em>fine</em> but definitely not the glorious beast that Sentinel became). Which again leads me back to <a href="https://mattischrome.com/a-pox-on-both-their-houses">sighing heavily about streaming</a>…</p>
