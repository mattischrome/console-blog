<h1>M1 External Monitor Issues</h1>
<p>May. 22, 2022</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>Since moving to an M1 Mac, I&rsquo;ve noticed some issues with my second screen that I do not experience with my previous Intel Mac or with my current work laptop, which is a Dell Intel PC running Windows 10.</p>
<p>I get a lot of flickering on the screen, which is intolerable if I have Pro-motion and True Tone turned on. Note that these are options for the main display rather than the external monitor. I think this means that Apple does not or cannot let you apply these settings granularly, they have to be on or off system-wide.</p>
<p>Even when these settings are off, there is still a slight flicker on my external monitor. The effect is stronger for darker apps, which is a problem for me as I am a big fan of dark mode. I wouldn&rsquo;t be happy to switch to lighter themes without resolving the issue, as I wouldn&rsquo;t want the issue there, latently waiting to strike, when I decide to play a game or edit a dark photo.</p>
<p>The effect is strong enough that I don&rsquo;t feel able to use the external monitor plugged into the Mac for long periods. This naturally has an impact on my work, as I prefer to work with the fastest machine available to me. Long form writing is easier in my Mac appsâ€”all my muscle memory is in those keyboard shortcuts. I&rsquo;d love to use R installed to my work machine, but because of the way the world is, we&rsquo;re left running it through some crappy virtual machine. (More autonomy over a corporate Windows machine is a terrifying prospect, akin to asking for the entire Necronomicon just for a couple of spells.)</p>
<p>I must say that I can&rsquo;t fault the way macOS handles windows with respect to the second monitor. The window arrangement features are intuitive and I&rsquo;ve even been able to use Universal Control effectively with this setup. The effect is purely visual and cannot be reproduced on the other two computers I&rsquo;ve mentioned. Even with this issue, using an external monitor on macOS is much better than on Windows, at least for short periods of time.</p>
<p>The monitor is an HP V28 4K. Perhaps it&rsquo;s not sufficiently advanced. At the best of times, it&rsquo;s good not great, but the fact is I&rsquo;d expect that a more expensive computer should make it look better rather than worse. I have a USB-C 4K adaptor to help my work PC run the screen at 4K, but even that doesn&rsquo;t help. I think it makes the problem slightly worse, though it does reassure me that the completely unnecessary HDMI port isn&rsquo;t defective.</p>
<p>Some people on forums with similar issues have given a DisplayPort to USB-C adaptor a try and had decent results. One of those would certainly be cheaper than the new Apple Studio Display, the existence of which is why I suspect that legacy monitors are not well served by M1 hardware. I don&rsquo;t have the funds for a fancy external display. In fact, I feel lucky to own a second screen at all (Thanks Black Friday!).</p>
<p>At WWDC next month, I really hope that the next iteration of macOS will be a Snow Leopard style sweep through some of the bugs that are holding back the Mac. I think support of legacy devices fits Apple&rsquo;s green credentials and it would help me save up for that Studio Display. After all, if I wanted to use a flickering display with poor driver support, Linux offers the same experience for a much smaller price tag!</p>
