    <p>Idewild are a solid band who have released four or five albums that I could consider for this series. I&rsquo;m even in the sleeve credits of one: <em>Post-Electric Blues</em>, if you&rsquo;re asking.</p>
<p>In the end I went for <em>100 Broken Windows</em> because it means a lot to me. It has more of a place in my life than the others. Usually I find that this happens if I can remember where I bought an album. In this case I bought a copy of the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22533522">cassette</a> in Bath HMV at Easter 2000. I can remember the first time that I listened to it too, it was as I marched home to Oldfield Park down Bathwick hill from the <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk">university</a> that same afternoon. It took exactly the two sides of the tape to get from one door to the other.</p>
<p>That period of time - from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door-to-door">door to door</a> - is about the perfect length for an album. Starting with <em>Little Discourage</em>, a wonderful little anthem about wanting the world and never getting it, the album tumbles and spits its way through side one. It pauses for breath with <em>Let Me Sleep (Next To The Mirror)</em> (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure that you&rsquo;ll be fine / ten more years of this it will nearly be time&rdquo;) but it has to after the tracks that precede it. You have <em>I Don&rsquo;t Have The Map</em>, which re-tells the <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/crusoe/">Robinson Crusoe</a> tale while relocating it to <a href="http://visit.shetland.org">the Shetlands</a>. <em>Roseability</em> is an anthem to philosopher <a href="http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poet/gertrude-stein">Gertrude Stein</a>: &ldquo;Gertrude Stein says that’s enough / I know that it’s not enough now”. Then there is a plea to see the world afresh in <em>These Wooden Ideas</em>: “You can&rsquo;t keep waiting for progress / You can wait but I can&rsquo;t accept at all&rdquo;. It all rushes by in such a brash and energetic fashion that side one seems to end within a heartbeat.</p>
<p>I should also mention <em>Idea Track</em> from side one. It&rsquo;s a <a href="http://www.freeform.org.uk">freeform</a> track, in keeping with its title, and it’s a song that taught me how to accept something unfinished-sounding. The &ldquo;chorus”, such as it is, is wonderfully crunchy and shouty, the sort of thing that Roddy had to give up on as time went on and wore out his voice. <em>100 Broken Windows</em> is the last of the Idlewild albums to feature shouty vocals. Many fans lament this but, the disastrous <em><a href="http://www.nme.com/reviews/7620">Warnings/Promises</a></em> aside, all their albums have been good - whether they are shouty or not. Oh and the coda of <em>Idea Track</em> foreshadows some of the sounds that would come later.</p>
<p>Side two launches with <em>Listen to what you&rsquo;ve got</em> (&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in these bad dreams / you might as well be talking backwards&rdquo;) and then explodes straight into <em><a href="http://songmeanings.com/songs/view/62235/">Actually its darkness</a></em> before you notice the blisters. <em>Actually its darkness</em> is a perfect <em>two</em> minute pop song, albeit slightly more pyromaniac than you might be used to. It makes me incredibly happy, especially the first delivery of the line: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re scared to say I&rsquo;m sorry I missed you&rdquo; that then gets the rejoinder &ldquo;<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Be-a-Cynic">why can&rsquo;t you be more cynical</a>?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The next two songs <em>Rusty</em> and <em>Mistake Pageant</em> are also great, a pair that would have been singles on any other album not already stuffed to the gills with hooks. The former is an out-an-out rocker with more shouting, the lyrics deriding someone who hides in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croft">croft</a> in search of authenticity. The latter is beautiful little song about bad parties and the social awkwardness that goes with them. I think this was the song I most related to as an undergraduate: “I know what it feels to have bad luck&rdquo;. It has wonderful <a href="http://www.hooksandharmony.com/20-great-r-e-m-songs/">R.E.M.-style harmonies</a>, which sets it apart nicely from the rest of the songs on the album.</p>
<p>The penultimate song <em>The Quiet Crown</em> is one of my all-time favourite songs. On my MSc at <a href="www.york.ac.uk">York</a>, I played this song at full volume on my walkman immediately before every exam for luck. A few years later, I would put the lyrics on my bedroom door. I am not sure if the lyrics were a message for me or someone else (that&rsquo;s all I am prepared to say). It&rsquo;s an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthem">anthem</a> and it has the lines &ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s gone wrong&rdquo;, &ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s broken now&rdquo; and &ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s gone running without a sound&rdquo; all delivered with the sense that the world is collapsing but somehow still fine. I think that’s what makes it suitable for exam tension and broken hearts in equal measure.</p>
<p>The album closes with the spare and strident <em>The Bronze Medal</em>, <a href="http://songmeanings.com/songs/view/62240/">a song I&rsquo;ve never quite figured out</a>. The chorus begins “Nothing but your eyes looking down on the third place&quot; and there is a sense of impossible sadness running throughout. I guess to be third place in a relationship is to be the wrong side of a love triangle, but then there is all that stuff about throwing the radio on to the fire as well. It was probably because the album closes in such a spooky way just as I reached home that made it such a rewarding accompaniment to my walk.</p>
<p>I love this album, listening to it again has reminded me of people, places, and times that are simultaneously gone yet also preserved forever inside me. I could only ever regard it as a complete and utter classic.</p>
