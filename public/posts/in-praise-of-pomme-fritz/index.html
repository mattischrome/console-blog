    <p>The release of Pomme Fritz by The Orb in 1994 was a moment of genuine excitement for me as it was the first new material they released after I&rsquo;d become aware of them. Not only that, but thanks to my hard work riding around Emsworth on my BMX at unsafe speeds belting out Green Day&rsquo;s Dookie as out-of-tune-ly as is humanly possible, I&rsquo;d managed to secure the funds to buy the album for myself. My excitement had been mounting from the moment the promotional postcard arrived a few weeks beforehand. I took my £4.99 to Our Price in Portsmouth Cascades on Saturday afternoon and bought myself a copy.</p>
<p>And boy, I pretty much hated it.</p>
<p>The first track was great<span class="marginfigure">

</span>, but the next two tracks: &ldquo;More Gills, Less Fishcakes&rdquo; and &ldquo;We&rsquo;re Pastie to be Grill You&rdquo; were - to my adventurous teenage ears - noisy codswallop! It took <em>years</em> for me to discern the subtle beats and rhythms underneath all the aggressively echo-boxed vocal samples, and even then it hardly seemed worth it. Those tracks must have sounded like panic attacks or paranoid delusions to listeners who had experienced such things, but I had no experience at that time to pin this waffle to.</p>
<p>Later, as I began to explore bands like CAN and Neu! I started to hear other pieces that helped me understand those tracks. The Orb&rsquo;s next album &ldquo;Orbus Terrarum&rdquo; (surely due a glorious vinyl reissue for its 30th anniversary <em>this</em> year?!) also helped me make sense of it - particularly the noisier digressions like &ldquo;Montagne D&rsquo;Or&rdquo; and &ldquo;Occidental&rdquo;. Fifteen years later when Pomme Fritz was reissued, the liner notes sheepishly referred to the &lsquo;album&rsquo; as an extended single, and that the noisier tracks were more like the more radical remixes you might find on a single (like the lovely mix of &ldquo;Oxbow Lakes&rdquo; by A Guy Called Gerald). Tellingly, the bonus disc of remixes sounded a lot more like the chilled out parts of the original album. All that noisy trauma, wiped away, along with most of its personality.</p>
<p>I always enjoy Pomme Fritz now. I&rsquo;ve always loved the cover. I like watching people&rsquo;s reactions to tracks 2 and 3: I may have hated them at first but I still memorised them and committed all their weird twists and turns to heart. It reminds me that you need grit to make a pearl, and that sometimes you have to work hard to find the beauty in art. Of course, it was just a load of stoners burning major label cash on a drug-fuelled vanity project, but it was definitely pastie to be grill you, the listeners near and far.</p>
