<h1>Underworld, Strawberrry Hotel</h1>
<p>Jan. 23, 2025</p>
<br/><br/>
<p>An album that arrived a bit too late to be considered in the best of the year list, <em>Strawberry Hotel</em> by Underworld is a solid effort. Their 11th album, it remarks their return to the format after five years after the <em>Drift</em> series in 2019.</p>
<p><em>Drift</em> had been an interesting experiment where Underworld had tried to put out a new track each week and grouping several weeks worth into EPs before putting out a massive 6+ hour box set. The striking thing about the project was that it was so good. They released a sampler edition of the album which cherry picked the best songs, but almost every track released as part of <em>Drift</em> could be swapped into that sampler.</p>

<p>And so the biggest surprise about <em>Strawberry Hotel</em> is how ordinary it sounds. At first it&rsquo;s fine. It shambles out with a cute a capella track called &ldquo;Black Poppies&rdquo; before roaring into a series of techno bangers &ldquo;Denver Luna&rdquo;, &ldquo;Techno Shinkansen&rdquo;, &ldquo;And the Colour Red&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sweet Lands Experience&rdquo;. Each of these would fit nicely on the first four Underworld albums and makes for a very propulsive start.</p>
<p>After that though, it does go a bit wibbly. There was an attempt to be as experimental as they were on the more casual projects like <em>Drift</em> and the Riverrun Project (why has there never been a nice box for this one guys?) but some of them don&rsquo;t really pay off. One of the more successful experiments is &ldquo;Ottavia&rdquo; where Rick&rsquo;s daughter reads a lament of Nero&rsquo;s wife in an English translation of the Italian opera &ldquo;L&rsquo;Incoronazione di Poppea&rdquo;. This is willfully odd but does grow on you with repeat listens.</p>
<p>Another highlight of the back half of the album is &ldquo;Gene Pool&rdquo;, one of their seemingly effortless long and twinkly instrumentals. But tracks like &ldquo;Oh Thorn!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Iron Bones&rdquo; don&rsquo;t really work for me. Perhaps they will grow on me like the middle of the album did.</p>
<p>In conclusion, it&rsquo;s a good album that perhaps pales in comparison to the highest highs of the Underworld catalogue. I think the best comparison is probably to <em>Oblivion with Bells</em>, an album that also begins with a few bangers (&ldquo;Crocodile&rdquo;, &ldquo;Beautiful Burnout&rdquo;), goes a bit weird in the middle (&ldquo;Ring Road&rdquo;, &ldquo;Holding the Moth&rdquo;, &ldquo;Cuddle Bunny Vs Celtic Villages&rdquo;) and rallying a bit at the end (&ldquo;Best Mamgu Ever&rdquo;).</p>
