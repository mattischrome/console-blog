    <p>May. 23, 2013</p>
    <p>It was quite hard to choose an 808 State album for the understated classics series for two reasons. The first is that I was introduced to 808 State quite late through a friend&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s cassette copy of The Shamen&rsquo;s En-Tact (the original version recorded from vinyl that had a thirteen minute version of &ldquo;Evil Is Eden&rdquo;) that also had &ndash; to fill out the C90 &ndash; the full length sweary version of &ldquo;What Time Is Love?</p>

    <p>This was a show that I had put off going to see for quite a while now. Looking online at the pictures featured in the show did not really excite me enough to get out and see it. I&rsquo;d seen Whaam! before in isolation (it&rsquo;s part of the Tate collection and will no doubt return once the retrospective show is over) and it didn&rsquo;t really grab me, arresting as it is.</p>

    <p>May. 20, 2013</p>
    <p>&ldquo;The Marriage Plot&rdquo; by Jeffrey Eugenides is a novel about love and growing up set in the privileged world of US academia in the early eighties. The main plot concerns a love triangle involving two guys and a girl. Madeline Hanna, the girl at the apex of the love triangle, is the main focus of the novel and the majority of the novel is told from her standpoint. I think her sections are incredibly well written but I&rsquo;d love the thoughts of a female reader, in case it is actually all a horribly male way of seeing through a young woman&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

    <p>May. 17, 2013</p>
    <p>I saw Star Trek: Into Darkness last night in 3D at the IMAX in Waterloo. I am going to have to separate this into a review into two parts, a review of the film and a review of the viewing experience. I am not completely happy with how the film experience is changed by the 3D and the super big screen and I will try to explain what I mean.</p>

    <p>Some great albums this month!
The Flaming Lips The Terror Wire Change Becomes Us James Blake Overgrown The Knife Shaking The Habitual The Flaming Lips The Terror How you view The Terror pretty much depends on how much you have kept up with The Flips output since their last official album, the clanking double behemoth in Merkin packaging that was Embryonic. The irony being that I used Embryonic to deal with a break-up and The Terror is pretty much about&hellip; a break-up.</p>

    <p>Apr. 11, 2013</p>
    <p>I was fifteen when I first read &ldquo;On The Road&rdquo; by Jack Kerouac and recently, after twice as much lifetime lived, I was able to watch the film version directed by Walter Salles.
The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars.</p>

    <p>Mar. 31, 2013</p>
    <p>Just the David Bowie album this month as it’s pretty much the only new music that I’ve listened to.
I must admit that I had no idea what to expect of “The Next Day”. It comes almost exactly ten years after “Reality”, an album that I have never really got into despite it having some pretty decent fun tracks like “New Killer Star” and a nice cover of “Pablo Picasso” that has never sent me in search of Jonathan Richman’s original.</p>

    <p>Mar. 18, 2013</p>
    <p>A while back, I decided I was going to write about the Iain M. Banks sci-fi-novels (mainly as a respite from having to read and write about J. G. Ballard novels, but I only got as fas as writing about the excellent “Against A Dark Barkground” and re-reading the first of the Culture novels “Consider Phlebas”. WARNING: Some plot spoilers follow (but not too many).
I’m not sure why it has taken almost two years to write about this novel.</p>

    <p>Mar. 13, 2013</p>
    <p>“Walking With Thee” is the second album by Liverpool band Clinic. It was released in 2002, which seems like an age ago now. Even longer ago they released the single “The Return of Evil Bill”, which was got me interested in them in the first place.
I recently got back into “Walking With Thee” when I picked “Vulture” in my A-Z of Animals playlist last month. I’d forgotten just how great a song it is, both musically and lyrically.</p>

    <p>I have had a lot of ideas for posts swirling around in my head in recent days. This is because I have actually done quite a lot of cool things in that time, and because I have hung out with some great people who make me think, and because I always have a whole load of things bouncing around in there anyway - space junk of the mind. I was thinking about how to put together these thoughts I have been having about art and about stories and yes, about love too.</p>

    <p>Most Februaries are quite quiet when it comes to albums (though this was not the case back in 2011) and although only the Foals album is a major release, I was quite surprised to find myself with four decent albums to write about. They are:
Darkstar &ldquo;News From Nowhere&rdquo; Foals &ldquo;Holy Fire&rdquo; Daniel Hope &ldquo;Spheres&rdquo; Apparat &ldquo;Krieg und Frieden (Music For Theatre)&rdquo; Darkstar &ldquo;News From Nowhere&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t need to give too much biographical background for the Darkstar album as I don&rsquo;t know too much about who the are.</p>

    <p>Feb. 26, 2013</p>
    <p>The existence, or impending existence, of a new novel by Thomas Pynchon was announced today. I have all his previous books (seven written over a period of about fifty years, a pace that I definitely approve of), though he’s a hard author to get close to: I’ve only finished three and started four up till now. The unfinished one is, of course, Gravity’s Rainbow (GR) and somewhat perversely, I have two copies of the thing.</p>
